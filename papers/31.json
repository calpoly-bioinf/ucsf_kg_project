Prescott*\n\nDepartment of Neurobiology and the Pittsburgh Center for Pain Research, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n\nAbstract\n\nPain caused by nerve injury (i.e. neuropathic pain) is associated with development of neuronal hyperexcitability at several\npoints along the pain pathway. Within primary afferents, numerous injury-induced changes have been identified but it\nremains unclear which molecular changes are necessary and sufficient to explain cellular hyperexcitability. To investigate\nthis, we built computational models that reproduce the switch from a normal spiking pattern characterized by a single\nspike at the onset of depolarization to a neuropathic one characterized by repetitive spiking throughout depolarization.\nParameter changes that were sufficient to switch the spiking pattern also enabled membrane potential oscillations and\nbursting, suggesting that all three pathological changes are mechanistically linked. Dynamical analysis confirmed this\nprediction by showing that excitability changes co-develop when the nonlinear mechanism responsible for spike\ninitiation switches from a quasi-separatrix-crossing to a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. This switch stems from biophysical\nchanges that bias competition between oppositely directed fast- and slow-activating conductances operating at\nsubthreshold potentials. Competition between activation and inactivation of a single conductance can be similarly\nbiased with equivalent consequences for excitability. \u2018\u2018Bias\u2019\u2019 can arise from a multitude of molecular changes occurring\nalone or in combination; in the latter case, changes can add or offset one another. Thus, our results identify pathological\nchange in the nonlinear interaction between processes affecting spike initiation as the critical determinant of how simple\ninjury-induced changes at the molecular level manifest complex excitability changes at the cellular level. We\ndemonstrate that multiple distinct molecular changes are sufficient to produce neuropathic changes in excitability;\nhowever, given that nerve injury elicits numerous molecular changes that may be individually sufficient to alter spike\ninitiation, our results argue that no single molecular change is necessary to produce neuropathic excitability. This deeper\nunderstanding of degenerate causal relationships has important implications for how we understand and treat\nneuropathic pain.\n\nCitation: Rho Y-A, Prescott SA (2012) Identification of Molecular Pathologies Sufficient to Cause Neuropathic Excitability in Primary Somatosensory Afferents\nUsing Dynamical Systems Theory.

The resulting spontaneous and evoked hyperactivity\n\ncontributes to neuropathic pain directly and by driving central\n\nsensitization [1,2,3]. Beyond simply becoming more excitable (i.e.\n\nhaving a lower activation threshold), three qualitative changes in\n\nexcitability stand out: a change in spiking pattern (Fig. 1A),\nmembrane potential oscillations (Fig. 1B) and bursting (Fig. 1C)\n[4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. These changes co-occur and have been\n\ndocumented in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons of various\n\nsizes, including putative high- and low-threshold afferents.\n\nHyperexcitability in low-threshold afferents is thought to underlie\n\nallodynia [5,13,14,15], which implicates central plasticity (e.g.\n\nunmasking of polysynaptic spinal circuits through disinhibition\n\n[16,17]) such that normally innocuous stimulation (causing\n\nexaggerated responses among hyperexcitable low-threshold\n\nafferents) can lead to activation of ascending pain pathways, thus\n\nenabling innocuous stimulation to elicit pain. The central nervous\n\nsystem is obviously required for pain perception, and central\n\nplasticity certainly contributes to the development of neuropathic\n\npain, but it is generally agreed that reversing peripheral\n\nhyperexcitability could relieve or markedly attenuate many\n\nvarieties of neuropathic pain [3]. Doing so has proven easier said\n\nthan done.\n\nCountless molecular changes have been documented to occur\n\nafter nerve injury and are correlated with cellular hyperexcitability\n\nand pain [[for reviews, see 18,19,20]. Still more injury-induced\n\nchanges are likely to occur but have yet to be described (Fig. 1D).\nMoreover, causal relationships are harder to ascertain than\n\ncorrelations. Knockout studies [e.g. 21,22] can demonstrate the\n\nnecessity of certain molecules for mediating changes in cellular\n\nexcitability, but those studies do not address sufficiency. If control\n\nof primary afferent excitability is degenerate, meaning distinct\n\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 1 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002524\n\n\n\nmolecular changes yield equivalent cellular outcomes [23], then a\n\ncertain molecular change may be sufficient but unnecessary to\n\nproduce hyperexcitability. Specifically, if more than one molecular\n\nchange is sufficient to cause cellular hyperexcitability, then\n\nblocking any one of those molecular changes will not prevent\n\nhyperexcitability if another molecular change can fill in. This\n\npossibility should be cause for alarm given that multiple changes\n\nco-occur following nerve injury (see above), yet this has not been\n\nconsidered in recent discussions on the lack of progress in\n\ntranslational pain research [24,25].\n\nThus, beyond considering which molecular changes are\n\nnecessary, it is also important (1) to identify which molecular\n\nchanges are sufficient to produce cellular hyperexcitability and\n\nwhy, and (2) to explain how co-occurring molecular changes\n\ninteract. Addressing these issues is complicated by the complex\n\nnature of excitability. Complexity stems from nonlinearities,\n\nwhich is to say that components of a system (e.g. ion channels\n\nwithin a neuron) compete, cooperate, or interfere with one\n\nanother [26]. A nonlinear system is not the sum of its parts, which\n\nmeans reductionist approaches provide incomplete, if not\n\nincorrect, explanations of complex phenomena. Dynamical\n\nsystems theory provides a more integrative approach but has\n\nnot been used hitherto to help explain primary afferent\n\nhyperexcitability.\n\nIn this study, we sought to identify what sorts of molecular\n\nchanges could, in theory, cause primary afferent hyperexcitability.\n\nThis is fundamentally different from identifying what changes\n\noccur after nerve injury. The two approaches are complementary\n\n(Fig. 1D), but whereas the latter has seen widespread use, the\nformer has not. Hence, the current study provides a novel\n\nperspective that should facilitate the interpretation of past results.\n\nRather than simulating known molecular changes, we worked in\n\nthe reverse direction by first reproducing known changes in\n\ncellular excitability and then using theory to help identify their\n\npotential molecular bases. Specifically, we reproduced previously\n\nreported [4] injury-induced changes in cellular excitability (see\n\nFig. 1A\u2013C) in the simplest possible conductance-based model.\nThen, through dynamical analysis of that model, we pinpointed a\n\nswitch in spiking mechanism as the common dynamical basis for\n\nall three excitability changes. In turn, we investigated the potential\n\nmolecular bases for the switch in spiking mechanism. As\n\nanticipated, several distinct molecular changes were found to\n\nproduce qualitatively identical changes in cellular excitability (by\n\nswitching the spike initiation mechanism), thus highlighting\n\ndegeneracy in the molecular basis for cellular excitability. We\n\nalso found that molecular changes can add together and offset one\n\nanother in terms of their influence on excitability. The implica-\n\nFigure 1.

Much is known about the multitude of molecular\nand cellular changes that are triggered by nerve injury\n(and which correlate with development of neuropathic\npain), but little is understood about how those changes\ncause neuropathic pain. Rather than identifying what\nchanges occur after nerve injury (which has already been\nthe focus of countless studies), our study focuses on\nidentifying which changes are functionally important.\nSpecifically, we explain how certain molecular changes,\nacting alone or in combination, cause a triad of neuro-\npathic changes in primary afferent excitability. Through\ncomputational modeling and nonlinear dynamical analysis,\nwe demonstrate that the entire triad of excitability\nchanges arises from a single switch in the nonlinear\nmechanism responsible for spike initiation. Going further,\nwe demonstrate that many distinct molecular changes are\nsufficient to produce that switch but that no single\nmolecular change is necessary if more than one sufficient\nchange co-occurs after nerve injury, which appears to be\nthe case. The issue becomes whether molecular changes\ncombine to reach some tipping point whereupon cellular\nexcitability is qualitatively altered. This highlights the\nimportance of nonlinearities for neuropathic pain and\nthe need for more computational pain research.\n\nDynamical Analysis of Neuropathic Excitability\n\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 2 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002524\n\n\n\ntions of these insights for understanding and treating neuropathic\n\npain are discussed.\n\nResults\n\nInjury-induced change in spiking pattern\nThe first of three pathological changes that we sought to\n\nreproduce in our computer model was the switch from onset-only\n\nspiking to repetitive spiking during sustained depolarization (see\n\nFig. 1A). Starting with a minimal conductance-based model (see\nEqn. 1\u20135 in Methods), we set parameters in order for the model to\n\nproduce onset-only spiking (Fig. 2A top) and then we varied\nparameters one at a time in order to switch the model to repetitive\n\nspiking (Fig. 2A bottom). We initially focused on the effects of\nvarying parameter bw, and we henceforth refer to the model with\nbw = 221 mV as \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 and to the model with bw = 213 mV\nas \u2018\u2018neuropathic\u2019\u2019. The biophysical meaning of a change in bw and\nthe effects of varying other parameters (in the same model or in\n\ndifferent models) are considered later in the Results.\n\nBased on our past work [27], we hypothesized that each spiking\n\npattern was associated with a dynamically distinct mechanism of\n\nspike initiation. To test this, we conducted bifurcation analysis in\n\nthe normal and neuropathic models. A bifurcation refers to a\n\nqualitative change in steady-state behavior, e.g. transition from\n\nquiescence to repetitive spiking. Bifurcation analysis involves\n\nsystematically varying a parameter of interest to determine at what\n\nvalue(s) of that parameter the system switches steady states, and\n\nhow that switch occurs. When we varied the stimulus current Istim,\n\nthe neuropathic model transitioned from quiescence to repetitive\n\nspiking through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation (Fig. 2B bottom)\nwhereas the normal model exhibited no bifurcation (Fig. 2B top).\nBoth models exhibited a range of Istim within which a single, onset-\n\nonly spike was generated independently of a bifurcation (see\n\nbelow).\n\nWe further characterized spike initiation using phase plane\n\nanalysis. Our starting model comprised just two variables, V and\n\nw, whose interaction is entirely responsible for how the model\n\nbehaves. Those interactions can be visualized by plotting V against\n\nw to create a phase plane, and can be analyzed by considering how\n\nthe nullclines intersect, where V- and w-nullclines represent\n\nlocations in phase space where V or w do not change. Points\n\nwhere the two nullclines intersect, referred to as fixed points, are\n\nespecially important for explaining spike initiation. Stimulation\n\ncaused a vertical shift in the V-nullcline, which, in the neuropathic\n\nmodel, caused the stable fixed point to become unstable (Fig. 2C\nbottom) \u2013 this is the geometric explanation for the Hopf\nbifurcation responsible for repetitive spiking. In the normal model,\n\nstimulation caused a similar shift in the V-nullcline, which allowed\n\nFigure 2. Simulation and dynamical explanation of change in spiking pattern. (A) Spiking pattern during sustained depolarization was\nconverted from onset-only (normal, bw = 221 mV) to repetitive (neuropathic, bw = 213 mV) by varying a single parameter. Onset-only spiking was\nobserved in the neuropathic model but for only a narrow stimulus range. (B) According to bifurcation analysis in which stimulation (Istim) was\nsystematically varied, repetitive spiking was produced by the neuropathic model when Istim exceeded a critical value required for a subcritical Hopf\nbifurcation. In contrast, the normal model did not undergo a bifurcation, which means spiking was limited to single spikes generated through a QS-\ncrossing (see below). Generation of a single spike does not constitute a change in steady-state behavior, consistent with the absence of a bifurcation.\n(C) Phase planes show the fast activation variable V plotted against the slower recovery variable w. Nullclines (color) indicate where V or w do not\nchange. Excitatory stimulation shifts the V-nullcline upward without affecting the w-nullcline. In the neuropathic model, V- and w-nullclines intersect\nat a stable (s) fixed point prior to stimulation, but that point becomes unstable (u) during stimulation \u2013 this corresponds to a Hopf bifurcation and is\nresponsible for repetitive spiking. In the normal model, the fixed point remains stable during stimulation despite the V-nullcline shifting upward, but\na single spike can nonetheless be generated depending on how the system moves to the newly positioned fixed point. The trajectory can be\npredicted by reference to a quasi-separatrix (QS), which corresponds to a manifold in phase space from which trajectories diverge. Quasi-separatrices\nwere plotted here by integrating with a negative time step with initial values indicated by * on the phase planes (see Methods). Like the V-nullcline,\nthe QS shifts instantaneously with stimulation. If, as shown, the original fixed point ends up below the shifted QS, the trajectory to the newly\npositioned fixed point must follow an indirect route around the end of the QS (*), thus producing a spike; a more direct, subthreshold route would\nrequire the trajectory to cross back over the QS, which is not possible. If the original fixed point remained above the shifted QS, the trajectory would\nfollow a direct route and no spike would be produced (not illustrated).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002524.g002\n\nDynamical Analysis of Neuropathic Excitability\n\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 3 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002524\n\n\n\none spike to be generated despite the fixed point remaining stable\n\n(Fig. 2C top). Rather than occurring through a bifurcation, spike\ngeneration in the latter case depended on the trajectory to the\n\nnewly positioned (but still stable) fixed point, as explained here. A\n\nquasi-separatrix (QS) corresponds a manifold in phase space from\n\nwhich trajectories diverge. The V-nullcline and QS shift instan-\n\ntaneously upon the onset of stimulation. Although the QS can\n\nmove, trajectories cannot cross a stationary QS and, instead, tend\n\nto diverge from it; therefore, if the QS shifts far enough during\n\nstimulation that the starting point of the trajectory (which\n\ncorresponds to the original fixed point) ends up below the shifted\n\nQS, the system will move to its new fixed point via an indirect\n\nroute around the end of the QS. See Prescott et al. [27] for more\n\ndetailed explanations of these dynamical mechanisms.\n\nThe biophysical meaning of these dynamical mechanisms in\n\nterms of competition between fast-activating inward current (a\n\npositive feedback process) and slower-activating outward current (a\n\nnegative feedback process) are explained in Fig. S1. Equivalent\nchanges can be observed in other minimal 2-D models, for\n\ninstance, if delayed rectifier potassium channel activation is\n\nreplaced with fast sodium channel inactivation (Fig. S2).\n\nInjury-induced development of membrane potential\noscillations (MPOs)\n\nThe second of three pathological changes that we sought to\n\nreproduce in our computer model was the development of MPOs\n\n(see Fig. 1B). We hypothesized that the same dynamical\nmechanism responsible for repetitive spiking also explains MPOs\n\nbecause the fixed point identified in Fig. 2C is a focus (i.e. it has\ncomplex eigenvalues), which means trajectories spiral into or away\n\nfrom that point depending on whether the point is stable or\n\nunstable, respectively (see inset of Fig. 2C top for sample\ntrajectory). Any noise within the system (e.g. channel noise [28];\n\nprimary afferent somata bear no synapses, thus excluding synaptic\n\nnoise) will continuously perturb the system away from its stable\n\nfixed point; as the system relaxes, it will return to the fixed point\n\nvia a spiral trajectory, thereby producing oscillations on the time\n\nseries [29]. Thus, one would expect noise-dependent MPOs whose\n\namplitude is inversely proportional to the stability of the fixed\n\npoint. Since a Hopf bifurcation represents destabilization of the\n\nfixed point (see above), noise-dependent MPOs should become\n\nprominent near the bifurcation. In biophysical terms, this\n\ncorresponds to inward current starting to activate but activation\n\nof outward current (or inactivation of inward current) catching up,\n\nthus preventing spike initiation but producing an MPO in the\n\nprocess.\n\nBased on these theoretical insights, we made three predictions:\n\n(1) noise-dependent MPOs should occur in the neuropathic model\n\nwhen it operates near a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, (2) noise-\n\ndependent MPOs should not occur in the normal model because\n\nthere is no Hopf bifurcation, (3) noise-independent MPOs should\n\nnot occur in either model because there is no stable, subthreshold\n\nlimit cycle on the bifurcation diagrams in Fig. 2B. To test these\npredictions, we ran simulations with and without noise in the\n\nnormal and neuropathic 2-D models (without having adjusted any\n\nmodel parameters). All three predictions were confirmed (Fig. 3A).\nThese results argue that repetitive spiking and MPOs are two\n\nmanifestations of the same dynamical mechanism, namely a\n\nsubcritical Hopf bifurcation, and become manifest when Istim is\n\nabove or just below the bifurcation point, respectively. In the\n\nabsence of a Hopf bifurcation, the system can neither spike\n\nrepetitively nor exhibit MPOs.\n\nPrevious efforts to model injury-induced MPOs in DRG\n\nneurons have not considered noise, and have thus necessarily\n\nfocused on solutions involving stable subthreshold limit cycles\n\n[8,30,31]. To contrast noise-independent and -dependent MPOs,\n\nwe adjusted our 2-D model to make it produce MPOs in the\n\nabsence of any noise. In this model, MPOs arose from a stable\n\nlimit cycle produced through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation\n\n(Fig. 3B). Compared with noise-dependent MPOs, noise-\nindependent MPOs were much larger and more regular as\n\nevidenced by large, narrow peaks on the power spectra (colored\n\ncurves on Fig. 3C). Published power spectra of experimental\nMPOs are broad [5,10,30], like the black power spectrum in\n\nFig. 3C, and are thus consistent with noise-dependent MPOs.\nMost published studies (see Introduction) have not included power\n\nspectral analysis, but the irregularity of MPOs in experimental\n\ntime series points to a noise-dependent oscillatory mechanism.\n\nPast experiments have shown that MPOs can occur over a\n\nbroad range of membrane potentials, and that MPO amplitude\n\nand peak frequency tend to increase with mean depolarization\n\n[4,10]. Figure 4 demonstrates that our model can reproduce\nthese MPO properties on the basis of a noise-dependent oscillatory\n\nmechanism. MPO amplitude grows as the average membrane\n\npotential approaches spike threshold (Fig. 4A). By comparison, for\nequivalent mean input, increasing noise amplitude shifts the power\n\nspectrum upward but does not change its shape (compare solid\n\nand dotted red curves), consistent with larger noisy perturbations\n\nbut equivalent relaxation toward the fixed point; indeed, the\n\nimaginary part of the fixed point\u2019s complex eigenvalue, which\n\nreflects the rate of winding around the fixed point, is unchanged by\n\nnoise. That said, stronger noise (which is arguably unphysiological\n\nin the case of DRG neurons and would overwhelm the intrinsic\n\noscillatory process) increases the likelihood of the voltage trajectory\n\ncrossing spike threshold; thus, probability of spike initiation\n\ndepends jointly on noise amplitude and the difference between\n\nmean depolarization and voltage threshold [see 32]. If threshold is\n\nshifted (e.g. by slow cumulative sodium channel inactivation, which\n\nis represented here by h; Fig. 4B), the voltage range across which\nMPOs occur becomes quite broad and is associated with a shift in\n\npeak MPO frequency (Fig. 4C). Implementation of cumulative\nsodium channel inactivation as a dynamical process in our model\n\n(see Eqns. 6\u20138) demonstrates the feasibility of a large shift in spike\n\nthreshold (Fig. 4D). Given that noise is ubiquitous, noise-\ndependent oscillations near a subcritical Hopf bifurcation provide\n\na robust dynamical explanation of MPOs without invoking any\n\nmechanism beyond that already required to explain repetitive\n\nspiking.\n\nInjury-induced development of bursting\nThe last of three pathological changes that we sought to\n\nreproduce in our model was the development of bursting (see\n\nFig. 1C). Bursting is a slow process relative to the timescale of\nindividual spikes. Because there is no variable with a sufficiently\n\nslow time constant in our 2-D model, we did not expect and nor\n\ndid we observe bursting in that model. However, the subcritical\n\nHopf bifurcation is known to allow elliptic bursting when a slow\n\nprocess, like spike frequency adaptation, causes the system to drift\n\nback and forth across the bifurcation [33,34]. This occurs because\n\na subcritical Hopf bifurcation has a region of bistability within\n\nwhich the neuron is quiescent or spiking depending on recent\n\nhistory (which is reflected in the adaptation) \u2013 this is an example of\n\nhysteresis. We reasoned, therefore, that adding adaptation to our\n\nneuropathic 2-D model (thus making it 3-D) should give rise to\n\nelliptic bursting, and that this might reproduce the bursting\n\nobserved experimentally in nerve-injured DRG neurons. To test\n\nthis, we added adaptation mediated through an AHP current IAHP\n(see Eqns. 9 and 10) without changing any other parameters. As\n\nDynamical Analysis of Neuropathic Excitability\n\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 4 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002524\n\n\n\nexpected, the neuropathic model exhibited bursts whose fre-\n\nquency and duration increased with depolarization (Fig. 5A). An\nenlarged view of the membrane potential (Fig. 5A inset) shows\nthe growth of MPOs preceding burst initiation, which has been\n\nobserved experimentally [4,7,12,35] and is a characteristic\n\nfeature of elliptic bursting caused by the trajectory spiraling\n\naway from the fixed point until it jumps to the stable limit cycle.\n\nNoise was included in these simulations and introduces random-\n\nness into the initiation and termination of each burst, but it is\n\nunnecessary for bursting. On the other hand, bursting is\n\ndependent on the subcritical Hopf bifurcation; therefore, adding\n\nadaptation to the normal model predictably failed to produce\n\nbursting (data not shown).\n\nFigure 5B explains the role of hysteresis in burst generation.\nThe inset shows a typical burst with each phase of the response\n\ncolored differently. Note that the burst starts and stops at different\n\nvalues of z, which is the activation variable for IAHP. The same\n\nresponse was projected onto a bifurcation diagram created by\n\ntreating z as the bifurcation parameter rather than letting it evolve\n\nfreely as a variable. The boundaries of the bistable region\n\ncorrespond to values of z at which the burst starts and stops. Fast-\n\nslow analysis can accurately predict whether adaptation will, for a\n\ncertain stimulus intensity, lead to bursting or to tonic spiking at a\n\nreduced rate (Fig. S3).\n\nImportantly, we did not tune parameters each time we sought to\n\nreproduce a different property; instead, MPOs and bursting were\n\naccurately reproduced in our model using the set of parameters\n\nchosen on the basis of spiking pattern in Fig. 2. Our results argue,\ntherefore, (1) that spiking pattern, MPOs and bursting are\n\nmechanistically linked through their mutual dependence on the\n\nspike initiation mechanism, and (2) that our model captured the\n\ncrucial nonlinearity (i.e. spike initiation) including how it is altered\n\nunder neuropathic conditions.\n\nContinuum of injury-induced changes\nBeyond reproducing normal and neuropathic states, a good\n\nmodel should account for the transition between states by\n\nreproducing the continuum of pathological change. We are\n\nunaware of experimental data that quantitatively describe the\n\nprogress of such changes, but one might reasonably assume that\n\naffected cells become more hyperexcitable as pathology worsens.\n\nTherefore, we tested values of bw between the nominally \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019\nvalue of 221 mV and the \u2018\u2018neuropathic\u2019\u2019 value of 213 mV using\n\nour standard 2-D model.

In the normal model, MPOs were\nnegligible regardless of noise conditions. In the neuropathic model, noise-dependent MPOs were present and were most prominent for Istim near the\nbifurcation, when the fixed point is nearly unstable.

Specifically, the minimum Istim required to elicit spiking\n\ndecreased as bw was increased, and the Istim range associated with\nonset-only spiking became progressively narrower as repetitive\n\nspiking became predominant. Both trends are consistent with\n\nqualitative experimental data [4].\n\nNext, we considered how MPOs changed within this same\n\nrange of bw. All simulations included noise and Istim was chosen to\nbe just below the threshold for repetitive spiking. We found that\n\nMPO amplitude decreased as bw was increased (Fig. 6B, black\ncurve). Because intermediate values of bw are associated with a\nsupercritical Hopf bifurcation (see Fig. 3B) that gives rise to large,\nnoise-independent MPOs (indicated by * on Fig. 6B) over a\nnarrow range of Istim, we re-tested with Istim further from threshold\n\nin order to isolate noise-dependent MPOs, but the same trend was\n\nobserved (Fig. 6B, gray curve). Adjusting as few as one other\nparameter could prevent the supercritical Hopf bifurcation from\n\noccurring at any bw value, but the same trend of decreasing MPO\namplitude was still observed (data not shown). Peak MPO\n\nfrequency also decreased over the same range of bw (Fig. 6C,\n\nsolid lines), which parallels the trend in minimal sustainable firing\n\nrate (dotted line) as expected from the type 2 excitability associated\n\nwith the Hopf bifurcation [27,36]. One might reasonably have\n\nexpected MPOs to become larger and faster as pathology worsens,\n\nbut the model clearly predicted the opposite. This unintuitive\n\ntrend is explained by the neuron becoming more prone to\n\nrepetitive spiking (see Fig. 6A) such that the large and fast MPOs\nobserved after mild pathological change (i.e. small changes in bw)\nare replaced by repetitive spiking as pathology worsens (i.e. larger\n\nchanges in bw); in other words, the upper limits of MPO amplitude\nand frequency are reduced as the lower limit (i.e. stimulus\n\nthreshold) for repetitive spiking decreases.\n\nResults presented thus far demonstrate that a switch in spike\n\ninitiation mechanism (from QS-crossing to subcritical Hopf\n\nbifurcation) is sufficient to explain the complete triad of excitability\n\nchanges outlined in Fig. 1A\u2013C. Despite extensive exploration of\nthe parameter space of two separate 2-D models (see also Fig. S2),\nwe could not find another dynamical explanation for the\n\ncombination of changes, consistent with the limited number of\n\nbifurcation mechanisms that are possible in a 2-D model [37],\n\nFigure 4.

In a higher dimensional system, the same\n\nswitch in spiking mechanism is sufficient to explain excitability\n\nchanges but we cannot prove that it is necessary, although\n\nparsimony argues in favor of our explanation. We now shift our\n\nfocus from what a switch in spike initiation can explain, to what\n\nexplains the switch in spike initiation. Specifically, we will now\n\nconsider the biophysical meaning of a neuropathic change in\n\nparameter bw and whether such a change is biologically plausible.\nLater, we will consider the effects of changing other parameters.\n\nBiophysical basis for a neuropathic change in spike\ninitiation\n\nStrictly speaking, bw represents the voltage at half-maximal\nactivation of the slow current, Islow (see Eqn. 4). Increasing bw from\n221 mV to 213 mV caused a rightward shift in Islow-V curve of\n\nthe model neuron (Fig. 7A), which corresponds to a shift in the w-\nnullcline (Fig. 7A inset); shifting the w-nullcline changes how the\nV- and w-nullclines intersect, which has direct implications for\n\nspike initiation dynamics (see Fig. 2). These results therefore argue\nthat an injury-induced change in the voltage-dependency of Islow\ncould account for repetitive spiking; indeed, variations in the\n\nvoltage-sensitivity of ion channel gating occur and are associated\n\nwith hyperexcitability [e.g. 38,39,40]. However, most previous\n\nresearch has focused on whether expression of certain ion channels\n\nis up- or down-regulated after nerve injury [41]. Varying bw can\nalso account for changes in ion channel density if one understands\n\nhow our \u2018\u2018minimal\u2019\u2019 computer model was constructed; specifically,\n\nIslow represents the sum of all ion currents with slow gating kinetics\n\n[42], meaning Islow comprises multiple currents that could be\n\nmodeled individually. To explain expression changes, we can\n\nungroup Islow into parts that have more specific molecular\n\ncorrelates. To this end, we replaced Islow with a delayed rectifier\n\nK\n+\n\ncurrent IK,dr and a subthreshold inward or outward current\n\nIsub whose activation properties are shown in Fig. 7B. This\nconverts the model from 2-D to 3-D, i.e. with three activation\n\nvariables instead of just two (compare Eqns. 1 and 11). Increasing\n\ninward Isub (akin to upregulating Nav1.3 expression [43]) or\n\ndecreasing outward Isub (akin to downregulating Kv1 expression\n\n[44]) shifted the (IK,dr+Isub)2V curve in the 3-D model (Fig. 7C\n\nand D, respectively) the same way as making bw less negative\nshifted the Islow-V curve in the 2-D model (cf. Fig. 7A); in other\nwords, distinct molecular changes are equally capable of causing\n\nrepetitive spiking, consistent with the equivalent effects of such\n\nchanges on spike initiation (see bifurcation diagrams in Fig. 7C\nand D).\n\nThese results demonstrate that a single parameter change in our\n\nminimal 2-D model can represent more than one biological\n\nchange. Furthermore, other parameters in the 2-D model affect\n\nspike initiation. To investigate this, we varied other parameters\n\none at a time and measured excitability. Starting from the same\n\n\u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 state (see Fig. 2A top), each parameter change was able\nto produce comparable \u2018\u2018neuropathic\u2019\u2019 states as evidenced by a\n\nHopf bifurcation (Fig. 8A\u2013D, right panels). Phase planes (left\npanels) illustrate how different parameter changes morph either\n\nthe V- or w-nullclines \u2013 the important observation is that each\n\nchange produced the same geometrical alteration in how the two\n\nnullclines intersect, which is a direct reflection of how fast and slow\n\ncurrents compete during spike initiation (see Fig. S1). Like for the\nbiological meaning of a change in bw (see Fig. 7), we can\nreasonably posit that other parameter changes in the 2-D model\n\ncan each represent more than one biological change.\n\nThese data emphasize the degeneracy of the molecular substrate\n\nfor cellular excitability, i.e. that distinct molecular pathologies can\n\nyield the same pattern of cellular hyperexcitability (see Introduc-\n\ntion). In fact, changing any parameter in the 2-D model can\n\npotentially produce the neuropathic change in spike initiation\n\nbecause our minimal model contains only the necessary and\n\nsufficient variables required to explain spike generation. If a\n\nconductance that does not influence spike initiation (e.g. one that\n\nactivates only at suprathreshold potentials) is added to the 2-D\n\nmodel (thus producing a 3-D model comparable to that used in\n\nFig. 7), altering that conductance will not affect excitability (Fig.\nS4). Notably, injury-induced changes in such currents could occur\nand would be correlated with cellular hyperexcitability (and\n\nneuropathic pain) without the molecular and cellular changes\n\nbeing causally related (see Fig. 1D). This illustrates the insensitivity\nof the pathological process to certain parameters [45]. On the\n\nother hand, a change in a functionally important parameter might\n\nalso fail to produce cellular hyperexcitability if that change is offset\n\nby a simultaneous change in a second parameter (Fig. 9A). We\n\nFigure 5. Simulation and dynamical explanation of bursting. (A) Sample responses at different average membrane potentials in the\nneuropathic model (bw = 213 mV) with slow adaptation mediated by IAHP. Noise was included in all simulations and makes the bursting irregular\n(and thus more realistic) but noise is not necessary for bursting.

Inset shows V and z during sample burst, where z\ncontrols activation of IAHP. The same response, with its differently colored burst and interburst phases, was projected onto the bifurcation diagram\ncreated by treating z as a bifurcation parameter. The model tracks the stable limit cycle branch, spiking repetitively as z increases until the end of the\nbranch is reached, at which point the burst stops. The model then tracks the stable fixed point as z decreases (during which noise-dependent MPOs\nwax and wane) until the fixed point becomes unstable, at which point another burst starts. Hysteresis is evident from the bursts starting and stopping\nat different values of z. This bifurcation diagram is flipped horizontally relative to those shown in other figures because the bifurcation parameter\nhere controls IAHP, which is an inhibitory current, whereas Istim (the bifurcation parameter used elsewhere) is excitatory.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002524.g005\n\nDynamical Analysis of Neuropathic Excitability\n\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 7 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002524\n\n\n\nillustrate this in Fig. 9 using our 2-D model, but the importance of\nthis observation is even greater for higher-dimensional models.\n\nConsider that biological changes accounted for by the same\n\nparameter might offset one another so that the parameter itself (in\n\nthe 2-D model) does not change; for example, a large increase in\n\ninward Isub could be offset by a large increase in outward Isub (in\n\nthe 3-D model) such that bw remains unchanged (in the 2-D\nmodel). The last two examples highlight the importance of co-\n\nvariability across parameters [45]. Notably, small co-variations may\n\nalso combine to cause hyperexcitability (Fig. 9B). Insensitivity and\nco-variability are both routinely overlooked in studies reporting\n\ninjury-induced changes in ion channel expression, thus compro-\n\nmising the definitive interpretation of those studies.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we combined computer modeling and analysis\n\nbased on dynamical systems theory to rigorously explain\n\nneuropathic changes in the excitability of primary somatosensory\n\nafferents. Beyond reproducing the quantitative increase in\n\nexcitability, our results demonstrate that three qualitative changes\n\nin excitability (i.e. repetitive spiking, MPOs and bursting) all arise\n\nfrom a switch in the nonlinear mechanism responsible for spike\n\ninitiation. In dynamical terms, spike initiation switches from a\n\nquasi-separatrix-crossing under normal conditions to a Hopf\n\nbifurcation under neuropathic conditions. These dynamical\n\nmechanisms represent different outcomes in the competition\n\nbetween positive and negative feedback, and generalize to different\n\nfeedback mechanisms (e.g. Na\n+\n\nchannel inactivation vs. K\n+\n\nchannel\n\nactivation). In biophysical terms, this switch occurs when\n\ncompetition between currents contributing to spike initiation\n\nbecomes biased. A multitude of different changes in different\n\nchannels are sufficient to produce the equivalent switch in spike\n\ninitiation dynamics by biasing the competition in favor of inward\n\ncurrent. A switch in spike initiation dynamics is thus sufficient (and\n\nvery likely necessary) to explain neuropathic changes in excitabil-\n\nity; by comparison, many different molecular changes may be\n\nsufficient to switch the spike initiation mechanism, but no single\n\nmolecular change is strictly necessary if more than one sufficient\n\nchange is triggered by nerve injury (see Introduction and Fig. 10).\n\nFollowing a \u2018\u2018top-down\u2019\u2019 modeling approach, we focused first on\n\nfinding generic solutions to explain excitability changes, and only\n\nthereafter did we consider how such solutions might be biologically\n\nimplemented. This contrasts a \u2018\u2018bottom-up\u2019\u2019 approach of incor-\n\nporating previously described injury-induced molecular changes\n\ninto a computer model to investigate whether those molecular\n\nchanges can account for changes in excitability. The two\n\napproaches are complementary but, prior to this study, the former\n\nhad not been used to investigate primary afferent hyperexcitabil-\n\nity, the implication being that no one has previously sought to\n\nspecifically identify which molecular changes are sufficient to\n\nexplain documented changes in excitability. Animal models of\n\nneuropathic pain can arguably recreate clinically relevant human\n\nconditions quite accurately, but such models exhibit a vast array of\n\nchanges at multiple levels, which can make interpreting those\n\nchanges prohibitively difficult, especially with respect to causality;\n\nirrelevant correlations are probably quite common (Fig. 10\nscenario 1). Our approach depends upon the empirical data\ncollected in animal models of neuropathic pain (1) to identify\n\ncellular changes requiring explanation, and (2) to identify\n\ncandidate molecular pathologies with which to explain those\n\ncellular changes. But with overwhelming amounts of such data\n\nalready collected, an alternative approach such as ours is needed\n\nto help interpret those data.\n\nInvariably, the question seems to arise: pathological alteration of\n\nwhich ion current is responsible (i.e. necessary) for hyperexcitabil-\n\nity? Our results demonstrate that the answer is not straightforward\n\n(see Fig. 10). Any change in any current has context-dependent\neffects insofar as that altered current interacts with other currents.\n\nIndeed, a single mutation in Nav1.7 channels can increase or\n\ndecrease excitability depending on the other channels present in\n\nthe neuron [46]. Therefore, the more important issue is if and how\n\ninteractions between currents are altered, and more specifically,\n\nwhether that alteration manifests a switch in spike initiation\n\ndynamics. We would argue that one should ask: of all the changes\n\ncaused by nerve injury, which are sufficient (alone or in\n\ncombination) to produce cellular hyperexcitability?

Empirical\n\ntesting in computer models is more feasible, but ideally a more\n\nstrategic, theory-based approach could be employed. Our iden-\n\ntification of spike initiation as the crucial nonlinearity linking\n\nsimple molecular changes with complex cellular changes con-\n\nstrains the search to those currents affecting spike initiation. Only\n\ncurrents active at subthreshold potentials can contribute (directly) to\n\nthe spike initiation process. Suprathreshold currents like high-\n\nvoltage-activated Cav1 and 2 channels are present in somatosensory\n\nafferents and contribute to processes like synaptic transmission.\n\nThose currents can be altered by nerve injury [47] and such changes\n\ncould contribute to neuropathic pain, but any association with\n\nprimary afferent hyperexcitability is likely to be purely correlative\n\nand therapies targeting those currents would be ineffective at\n\nreversing hyperexcitability; however, the analgesic efficacy of\n\ngabapentenoid drugs acting on the a2-d subunit of Cav1 and 2\nchannels [48,49] clearly implicates other mechanisms as critical\n\nfactors for pain processing. But even if primary afferent hyperex-\n\ncitability is neither necessary nor sufficient to produce neuropathic\n\npain (see Introduction), primary afferent hyperexcitability is an\n\nFigure 7. Relating parameter changes in the 2-D model with more biologically meaningful changes in a 3-D model. (A) Changing bw\nfrom 221 mv to 213 mV shifts the Islow-V curve to the right, which corresponds to a rightward shift in the w-nullcline on the V-w phase plane (inset)\nand switches the spike initiation mechanism (see Fig. 2). In the 2-D model, bw represents the voltage-dependency of Islow which, in reality, comprises\nmultiple currents with slow kinetics. The biological realism of the model can be increased by \u2018\u2018ungrouping\u2019\u2019 Islow into two (or more) components, one\nrepresenting the delayed-rectifier potassium current IK,dr and one representing a subthreshold current Isub that can be inward or outward depending\non the reversal potential. (B) Voltage-dependent activation curve for Isub. Parameter values (indicated on the figure) were determined as explained\nbelow. In the 3-D model, the (IK,dr+Isub)2V curve was shifted the same as the Isub-V curve in A by increasing inward Isub (C) or by decreasing outward\nIsub (D) on the basis of varying gsub. Bifurcation diagrams demonstrate the change in spike initiation mechanism. With IK,dr properties fixed, maximal\nconductance and voltage-sensitivity of Isub were adjusted to recreate the shift shown in A; derived parameters illustrate the importance of the\nmodulated conductance activating at subthreshold potentials. Adding or removing the same subthreshold currents to a Hodgkin-Huxley model\n(rather than to our starting 2-D Morris-Lecar model) produces equivalent changes in excitability (data not shown). By comparison, modulating current\nthat activates only at suprathreshold potentials (by = 0 mV) had no effect on the (IK,dr+Isupra)2V curve in the perithreshold voltage range, and thus the\nspike initiation dynamics were unchanged (see Fig. S4).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002524.g007\n\nDynamical Analysis of Neuropathic Excitability\n\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 9 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002524\n\n\n\nimportant contributing factor [3]. Our data highlight the nuances\n\nand complicated nature of the molecular basis for just this one\n\ncontributing factor.\n\nAlthough we have ruled in subthreshold currents as playing a\n\ncritical role in spike initiation and excitability, it cannot be\n\nassumed that even large changes in a subthreshold current will\n\nnecessarily lead to cellular hyperexcitability, let alone neuropathic\n\npain. Cellular excitability may or may not be affected depending\n\non concurrent changes in other currents that could offset the first\n\nchange (Fig. 10, scenarios 3 and 4). This raises an important\npoint: most studies have focused on characterizing injury-induced\n\nchanges in one channel, or perhaps a few channels, but a definitive\n\nexplanation of whether such changes are sufficient to cause cellular\n\nhyperexcitability requires one to account for co-variations by\n\nmeasuring expression levels of all channels involved in spike\n\ninitiation. Worse yet, this complete analysis should be done on a\n\ncell-by-cell basis since different neurons may achieve equivalent\n\nexcitability based on different combinations of channel densities\n\n[50,51,52]. Beyond expression levels, we must also consider that\n\nchannel function can be modulated [53].\n\nIn terms of developing new analgesics that are more effective\n\nagainst neuropathic pain, it is arguably less important to\n\nunderstand precisely which molecular changes combine to cause\n\nhyperexcitability than it is to understand which molecular\n\nprocesses should be targeted when trying to therapeutically reverse\n\nhyperexcitability. In other words, one need not reverse underlying\n\nmolecular changes if cellular excitability can be normalized via\n\nother (potentially more druggable) targets. By this logic, one\n\nshould focus on the sufficiency (and likely necessity) of a dynamical\n\nchange in spike initiation for explaining hyperexcitability rather\n\nthan being preoccupied with the degeneracy of the molecular basis\n\nfor that switch. Indeed, whereas the diversity of molecular changes\n\ncontributing to hyperexcitability makes it difficult to understand\n\nthe exact pathogenic process (see above), that same diversity\n\nbroadens the range of drug targets whereby hyperexcitability\n\nmight be corrected. However, degeneracy of the molecular\n\nsubstrate for cellular excitability has another important implica-\n\ntion: if neuropathic pain results from maladaptive plasticity\n\n[20,54], then the therapeutic efficacy achieved through effects\n\non one ion channel could be offset (i.e. nullified) by misguided\n\nhomeostatic plasticity in any one of several other ion channels.\n\nThis might help explain the relative intractability of neuropathic\n\npain, and suggests that we must be prepared to block or reverse\n\nchanges in each and every ion channel affected by maladaptive\n\nhomeostatic plasticity or, better yet, that we address the\n\nhomeostatic plasticity rules themselves rather than the diverse\n\nagents upon which those rules act. The diversity of molecular\n\npathologies contributing to neuropathic pain is arguably well\n\nrecognized, but the implications described above are not. Our\n\nresults caution against that oversight.\n\nOur results also demonstrate how simple molecular changes can\n\nmanifest complex changes in cellular excitability because of how\n\nmolecular processes interact. The nonlinear nature of those\n\ninteractions is key for enabling small quantitative changes in the\n\ninteracting processes to cause large qualitative changes in the\n\noutcome. Indeed, this is the case for spike initiation insofar as there\n\nis a critical point (defined by a balance of time- and voltage-\n\ndependent feedback mechanisms) that determines whether an all-\n\nor-none spike will be produced. Notably, if a simple conductance-\n\nbased model can accurately reproduce phenomena of interest,\n\nthen it is necessarily true that a more complicated, biologically\n\nrealistic model (i.e. with more variables and parameters) will be\n\nable to do the same. That said, finding the required set of\n\nparameter values within the larger parameter space of the more\n\ncomplicated model may prove prohibitively difficult. Nonetheless,\n\neither type of model could be used to study the phenomena \u2013 the\n\nchoice of model depends on the specific questions and how one\n\nintends to answer them. In our case, we started with a simple\n\nmodel because we sought to rigorously characterize (pathological\n\ndisruption of) fundamental mechanisms of excitability using tools\n\nlike phase-plane analysis. Once that characterization was com-\n\nplete, we increased the biological realism of our model (see Fig. 7)\nto facilitate its biological interpretation. Our results demonstrate\n\nthe utility of such an approach.\n\nTo summarize, our results demonstrate that a switch in spike\n\ninitiation mechanism is sufficient and most likely necessary to\n\nexplain a constellation of neuropathic changes in primary afferent\n\nFigure 8.

All models are single compartment, which is\n\nFigure 9. Effects of multiple co-occurring molecular changes. (A) A parameter change affecting a subthreshold current (in this case in the\noriginal 2-D model) may fail to cause hyperexcitability if that change is offset by a change in a second parameter. In this example, varying bw shifts\nthe w-nullcline whereas varying cm re-shapes the V-nullcline, but the combination of changes results in no change in the geometry of the nullcline\nintersection. Parameter values are indicated on the bifurcation diagrams; the color of each label corresponds to the color of nullclines shown on the\nV-w phase plane. (B) Changes in excitability (quantified as the Istim threshold for repetitive spiking) caused by co-varying bw and cm. The increase in\nexcitability caused by varying only bw (arrow a) could be produced by a much smaller change in cm (arrow b) or by small combined changes in bw\nand cm (arrow c). Arrow d shows conditions in A. Note that the reduction in cm required to offset a \u2018\u2018neuropathic\u2019\u2019 change in bw (arrow e) is larger than\nthe increase in cm required to produce neuropathic excitability (arrow b). Systematic testing of all parameter combinations is beyond the scope of the\ncurrent study, but this example highlights the importance of parameter co-variation.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002524.g009\n\nFigure 10. Summary of relationships between molecular and cellular changes. (Scenario 1) A molecular change of interest outside the\nred-shaded region is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause hyperexcitability, but may nevertheless be correlated with it. (Scenario 2) In the\nabsence of other changes, a molecular change of interest inside the red-shaded region is both necessary and sufficient to cause hyperexcitability.\n(Scenario 3) If only one molecular change occurs inside the red-shaded region, that change will be necessary for hyperexcitability but may or may\nnot be sufficient depending on how the change interacts with other changes outside the red-shaded region. (Scenario 4) If multiple molecular\nchanges occur inside the red-shaded region, then the change of interest will not be necessary for hyperexcitability and may or may not be sufficient\ndepending on how that change interacts with other changes. This last scenario (hightlighted in yellow) is the most likely given that nerve injury\ntriggers multiple molecular changes and given the degenerate manner by which spike initiation can be altered, as shown in this study. Degeneracy\nimplies that the red circle is large and thus likely to significantly overlap the gray circle.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002524.g010\n\nDynamical Analysis of Neuropathic Excitability\n\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 11 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002524\n\n\n\nimportant for enabling our analysis but is also an accurate\n\nrepresentation of acutely isolated somata used in most electro-\n\nphysiological experiments on dorsal root ganglion neurons,\n\nincluding those reproduced in Fig. 1.

Phase plane analysis was\n\nconducted in XPP and bifurcation analysis was conducted with\n\nAUTO using the XPP interface. Excellent introductions to these\n\nforms of nonlinear dynamical analysis are available in\n\n[26,33,34,37]. In Fig. 2C, the quasi-separatrix (QS) was plotted\non the V-w phase plane by integrating backward in time starting\n\nfrom the point indicated by *. That point was chosen based on\n\nwhere forward trajectories (with slightly different starting values)\n\neventually diverge after clinging to the QS. The region of\n\ndivergence marks the end of the QS and is therefore a good\n\nlocation from which to begin plotting the reverse trajectory\n\nrepresenting the QS.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Spike initiation dynamics represent compe-\ntition between feedback mechanisms. Spike initiation\ndepends on competition between fast-activating, net inward\n\ncurrent (a positive feedback process) and slower-activating, net\n\noutward current (a negative feedback process). A spike is initiated\n\nwhen positive feedback proceeds unchecked by negative feedback.\n\nFast current comprises Ifast, Ileak and Istim. Slow current comprises\n\nonly Islow. (A) Sample responses from the normal and neuropathic\nmodels to just-suprathreshold stimulation (starting at t = 0 ms with\n\nIstim = 60 and 45 mA/cm\n2\n, respectively). Insets labeled a\u2013d show\n\nenlarged views during successful or unsuccessful spike initiation.\n\nArrows mark where dV/dt starts to increase because of runaway\n\npositive feedback. In the normal model (top), inward and outward\n\ncurrent are both strongly activated and the former just wins (a);\n\nDynamical Analysis of Neuropathic Excitability\n\nPLoS Computational Biology | www.ploscompbiol.org 12 May 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e1002524\n\n\n\nafter one spike, outward current settles at a new steady-state that is\n\nsufficiently strong to prevent further spiking (b). In the neuropathic\n\nmodel, inward current starts activating with relatively little\n\ncounterbalancing response from outward current during the first\n\nand later spikes (c, d). The competition can also be visualized by\n\nplotting currents against each other (B) rather than against time, as\nin A. Right graph shows enlarged view of yellow region on left graph\n\nand highlights the spike initiating phase. Labels a\u2013d correspond to\n\nthose in A. In normal conditions (green), the steep trajectory labeled\n\na indicates that outward current, despite its slower kinetics, almost\n\nmanages to counterbalance fast-activating inward current, and in\n\nfact this does occur in the failed spike labeled b. In neuropathic\n\nconditions (red), the shallower trajectories labeled c and d show that\n\ncompetition has become biased in favor of inward current. The\n\ndifference between trajectories suggests that slow-activating outward\n\ncurrent is relatively weaker or that fast-activating inward current is\n\nrelatively stronger under neuropathic conditions. To summarize, in\n\nthe normal model, fast-activating inward current only ever \u2018\u2018wins\u2019\u2019\n\nat short latencies after stimulus onset, before slower-activating\n\noutward current reaches its new steady state; at steady state,\n\noutward current is sufficient to stabilize the system and thereby\n\nprevent further spiking. In contrast, in the neuropathic model,\n\nsteady state outward current is insufficient to counterbalance fast-\n\nactivating inward current when stimulation exceeds a critical\n\nintensity, and repetitive spiking ensues.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S2 Spike initiation in model with Na\n+\n\nchannel\ninactivation instead of K\n\n+\nchannel activation. In our\n\nstandard 2-D model (see Eqns. 1\u20135), spikes are generated on the\n\nbasis of competition between fast-activating Na\n+\n\ncurrent and\n\nslower-activating K\n+\n\ncurrent. These two processes represent fast\n\npositive feedback and slow negative feedback, respectively. Slow\n\nnegative feedback can also be mediated by sodium channel\n\ninactivation, according to\n\nC dV=dt~{gfast m?

S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 are essentially\n\nequivalent to Eqn. 1\u20135. Parameters were the same as in our standard\n\n2-D model except for the following: bm = 25 mV, cm = 15 mV,\nbh = 227 mV or 230 mV and ch = 28 mV. Notably, the Na\n\n+\n\nchannel inactivation modeled here is much faster than that modeled\n\nin Eqn. 7 and 8, but h nevertheless changes slowly relative to\n\nactivation m. (A) The model with bh = 230 mV exhibited onset-only\nspiking generated through a QS-crossing and negligible MPOs over\n\na broad range of Istim. Compare with top row of Figure 2.\nOrientations of the V- and h-nullclines differ from those in Figure 2,\nbut both nullclines are inverted such that their intersection with each\n\nother is unchanged. (B) The model with bh = 227 mV exhibited\nrepetitive spiking generated through a subcritical Hopf bifurcation\n\nand sizeable MPOs as the stable fixed point neared instability.\n\nCompare with bottom row of Figure 2. These data demonstrate\nthat regardless of exactly how the model is constructed, spike\n\ninitiation depends on competition between fast positive feedback and\n\nslower negative feedback. Neuropathic changes in excitability\n\nrepresent a qualitative change in the outcome of that competition.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S3 Fast-slow analysis of adaptation. (A) Sample\nresponses to stimulation with Istim = 43 mA/cm\n\n2\n(left) and 46 mA/\n\ncm\n2\n\n(right) in the 3-D neuropathic model (bw = 213 mV) with\nadaptation. Bifurcation analysis of the fast subsystem was conducted\n\nby systematically varying z, like in Figure 5; those results are shown\n\nwith black and gray curves in B and C. In B, we overlaid the z-\nnullcline (green) and Vequivalent (red), which corresponds to the\n\nvoltage that would produce adaptation equivalent to the average\n\nadaptation within one inter-spike interval, where that interval is a\n\nfunction of z [see ref. S1 for details]. For both stimulus intensities,\n\nthe z-nullcline does not intersect the stable-fixed-point-branch of the\n\nfast subsystem, which predicts that adaptation will not stabilize the\n\ncell in a quiescent state [ref. S2]. By comparison, for strong\n\nstimulation, the z-nullcline intersects the stable branch of Vequivalent\n(*), which predicts that adaptation will stabilize at that intersection\n\npoint, resulting in tonic spiking at a fixed rate, whereas for weak\n\nstimulation, the z-nullcline intersects the unstable branch of\n\nVequivalent (inset), which predicts that adaptation will not stabilize,\n\nthus resulting in bursting. In the latter case, z increases toward a\n\nvalue which, if it could be reached, would stabilize the neuron at a\n\ntonic firing rate, but spiking stops before that value is reached, at\n\nwhich point z falls until spiking resumes \u2013 repeated unsuccessful\n\nattempts to reach this unattainable value of z causes bursting. In C,\nresponses from the 3-D model (same as in A) are projected onto the\n\nbifurcation diagrams, and confirm the predictions explained in B.\n\nS1.

Within primary afferents, numerous injury-induced changes have been identified but itremains unclear which molecular changes are necessary and sufficient to explain cellular hyperexcitability. To investigatethis, we built computational models that reproduce the switch from a normal spiking pattern characterized by a singlespike at the onset of depolarization to a neuropathic one characterized by repetitive spiking throughout depolarization.Parameter changes that were sufficient to switch the spiking pattern also enabled membrane potential oscillations andbursting, suggesting that all three pathological changes are mechanistically linked. Dynamical analysis confirmed thisprediction by showing that excitability changes co-develop when the nonlinear mechanism responsible for spikeinitiation switches from a quasi-separatrix-crossing to a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. This switch stems from biophysicalchanges that bias competition between oppositely directed fast- and slow-activating conductances operating atsubthreshold potentials. Competition between activation and inactivation of a single conductance can be similarlybiased with equivalent consequences for excitability. \u2018\u2018Bias\u2019\u2019 can arise from a multitude of molecular changes occurringalone or in combination; in the latter case, changes can add or offset one another. Thus, our results identify pathologicalchange in the nonlinear interaction between processes affecting spike initiation as the critical determinant of how simpleinjury-induced changes at the molecular level manifest complex excitability changes at the cellular level. Wedemonstrate that multiple distinct molecular changes are sufficient to produce neuropathic changes in excitability;however, given that nerve injury elicits numerous molecular changes that may be individually sufficient to alter spikeinitiation, our results argue that no single molecular change is necessary to produce neuropathic excitability. This deeperunderstanding of degenerate causal relationships has important implications for how we understand and treatneuropathic pain."}
