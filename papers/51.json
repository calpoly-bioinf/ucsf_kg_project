Despite numerous previous fMRI studies,\nhowever, it remains open which spatial distribution of activity is sufficient to encode whether a stimulus is per-\nceived as painful or not. In this study, we analyzed fMRI data from a perceptual decision-making task in which\nparticipants were exposed to near-threshold laser pulses. Using multivariate analyses on different spatial scales,\nwe investigated the predictive capacity of fMRI data for decodingwhether a stimulus had beenperceived as pain-\nful. Our analysis yielded a rank order of brain regions: during pain anticipation, activity in the periaqueductal\ngray (PAG) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) afforded themost accurate trial-by-trial discrimination between pain-\nful and non-painful experiences; whereas during the actual stimulation, primary and secondary somatosensory\ncortex, anterior insula, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and OFC were most discriminative. The\nmost accurate prediction of pain perception from the stimulation period, however, was enabled by the combined\nactivity in pain regions commonly referred to as the \u2018pain matrix\u2019. Our results demonstrate that the neural rep-\nresentation of (near-threshold) pain is spatially distributed and can be best described at an intermediate spatial\nscale. In addition to its utility in establishing structure-functionmappings, our approach affords trial-by-trial pre-\ndictions and thus represents a step towards the goal of establishing an objective neuronal marker of pain\nperception.\n\n\u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.Open access under CC BY license.\nIntroduction\n\nThe perception of pain is amulti-factorial experience that comprises\nsensory, cognitive, and affective aspects. Accordingly, pain is thought to\nresult from a complex interplay between many regions in the human\nbrain, including the thalamus, insula, primary and secondary somato-\nsensory, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex (Apkarian et\nal., 2005). The specific characteristics of regions underlying the percep-\ntion of pain have been described in some detail using conventional uni-\nvariate analysis methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI). By contrast, there have been almost no attempts at examining\nthe distributed representation of pain and how it is encoded jointly by\nComputer Science, ETH Zurich,\n+41 4463 44 907.\nl Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nurosciences, Nuffield Division\n.

One particularly versatile\napproach, termedmultivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), is based on the\nuse of a classification algorithm to infer a perceptual or cognitive state\nfrom brain activity. The underlying multivariate decodingmodels differ\nin important ways from univariate encodingmodels, such as the gener-\nal linearmodel (GLM). Univariate analyses have provenpowerful for in-\nference on structure-function mappings in the brain when activations\nare expressed in terms of local peaks or clusters of activity (Friston et\nal., 1995). However, they are less suitable for assessing the amount of\ninformation encoded in spatially distributed (multivoxel) patterns of\nactivity underlying specific perceptual or cognitive states. This informa-\ntion can be estimatedusingmultivariate decodingmodels (Friston et al.,\n2008; Haynes and Rees, 2006; Norman et al., 2006; O'Toole et al., 2007;\nPereira et al., 2009). These models consider several voxels at the same\ntime and may therefore be more sensitive than univariate models (for\nan analysis of the conditions under which this is the case, see Guyon\nand Elisseeff, 2003).\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.08.035\nmailto:kay.brodersen@inf.ethz.ch\nmailto:kwiech@fmrib.ox.ac.uk\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.08.035\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10538119\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\n\npainful?\n\nyes no\n\ncue\n\n(4-8 s)\n\ndelay\n\n(4-6 s)\n\ndecision\n\n(until response)\n\ninter-trial interval\n\n(10-12 s)\n\nstimulus button press\n\n+\n\ntime\n\nb\nlaser intensity\n\n\u2026 \u2026\n120 trials\n\n(subject 1)\n120 trials\n\n(subject 2)\n\nsubject-specific\n\npain thresholds\n\na\n\nFig. 1.

Brodersen et al. / NeuroImage 63 (2012) 1162\u20131170\nDecoding approaches are typically implemented in the form of clas-\nsification algorithms. The results of such algorithms are often reported\nin terms of classification accuracies. It is important to remember, how-\never, that in cognitive neuroscience the absolute accuracy is not of pri-\nmary interest if, aswe dohere, onewishes to demonstrate the existence\nof a structure-function relationship in the brain, e.g., the relationship\nbetween measures of brain activity and a perceptual state (Friston et\nal., 2008). Such a relationship is evidenced by the significance with\nwhich the accuracy is above chance, not by itsmagnitude, since the sig-\nnificance takes into account bothmean and variability in the group. This\nis different in engineering applications such as the design of brain-\nmachine interfaces, where substantive significance, i.e., the magnitude\nof classification accuracy, is of interest. Thus, inferences in this paper\nare not based on accuracies but on the question ofwhether the reported\naccuracies are significantly above chance; similarly, comparisons are\nnot based on absolute differences in accuracies but on the question of\nwhether two accuracies differ significantly. We will revisit this distinc-\ntion in the Discussion.\n\nThe utility of classification approaches has been demonstrated in\nmany domains of systems neuroscience, but corresponding insights\ninto the perception of pain have remained scarce. In one methodologi-\ncal study, the utility of Gaussian processes was illustrated using differ-\nent levels of pain as well as graded responses to similar levels of pain\n(Marquand et al., 2010). Another technical study considered the tempo-\nral evolution of perception in response to prolonged noxious stimula-\ntion (Prato et al., 2011).\n\nThese studies have suggested that predicting pain from brain re-\ncordings may be feasible. However, it has remained unclear to what ex-\ntent the extraction of pain-related information benefits from the\nsimultaneous consideration of multiple brain regions. More specifically,\nit is not well understood which spatial scale2 is optimal for decoding\npain: individual voxels, single anatomical regions, combinations of re-\ngions, or whole-brain activity? Moreover, it is currently unknown\nwhat predictive capacity is enabled by those anatomical regions (and\ntheir combinations) that are typically associated with pain. Finally, there\nhas been no investigation of pain encoding that assesses voxel-wise sig-\nnificances (e.g., t-scores) in a multivariate fashion.\n\nIn the present study, we addressed the above questions by analyzing\nthe predictive capacity of individual and multiple brain regions in\ndecoding the subjective experience of pain. Notably, we carry out this\nanalysis in the setting of rather subtle (near-threshold) pain stimuli.\nThis is challenging but important since decoding results may otherwise\nbe dominated by physical differences in sensory stimulation rather than\ndifferences in subjective pain experience. First, we aimed to predict pain\nperception fromwhole-brain fMRI data on a trial-by-trial basis. Second,\nwe examined which spatial level of description enabled the most accu-\nrate predictions of pain: single voxels, individual anatomical regions,\ncombinations of regions, or whole-brain activity. For both questions,\nwe trained and tested a linear support vector machine (SVM) on\ntrial-specific correlates of whole-brain activity using a leave-one-\nsession-out cross-validation scheme. Third, we evaluated SVM-based\nvoxel weights with a permutation test to illustrate the spatial deploy-\nment of jointly informative voxels throughout the brain.\n\nMethods\n\nParticipants\n\nTo study the multivariate nature of pain-related activity in the brain,\nwe revisited a dataset that was originally analyzed using conventional\nunivariate methods (Wiech et al., 2010). Here, we provide a summary\nof the underlying experimental design, focusing on those aspects that\n2 It should be noted that the term \u2018scale\u2019 does not imply a physical scale parameter\nhere but is used to refer to the spatial composition of the feature space, i.e., the size\nof the search volume used for classification.\nare relevant for the question addressed in the present paper. A group\nof 16 volunteers (age range 19\u201330 years, 11 females, all right-handed),\nwith no history of neurological or psychiatric illnesses or chronic pain,\nparticipated in the study. All participants gave informed consent, and\nthe study was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee.\n\nExperimental design\n\nSubjects were engaged in a sensory decision-making task con-\nsisting of carefully calibrated laser stimulation and an additional\nthreat manipulation (Fig. 1). The experiment consisted of four ses-\nsions, each comprising 30 trials, totaling 120 trials per subject. On\neach trial, a near-threshold laser stimulus was applied to one out of\nsix possible stimulation sites on the right foot. Following the laser\npulse, participants were prompted to indicate by button press wheth-\ner the stimulus had been perceived as painful or non-painful.\n\nThe design contained an additional factor which was of no interest\nin the present analysis, but whose details we briefly outline for com-\npleteness (see Wiech et al., 2010, for a full description). At three stim-\nulation sites, participants were made to believe that the stimulation\nwas safe and approved without reservations (\u2018low threat\u2019 condition).\nAt the remaining three sites, participants were told that the stimula-\ntion would still be performed but could only be approved with reser-\nvations, as a result of an assessment of skin properties prior to the\nexperiment (\u2018high threat\u2019 condition). Unknown to participants, the\nassignment of the six sites to the two conditions (low threat vs.\nhigh threat) was defined a priori and entirely unrelated to any actual\nskin properties. On each trial, a visual cue informed subjects whether\npress whether the stimulus had been perceived as painful (here: left button for\n\u2018pain\u2019, right button for \u2018no pain\u2019). Assignment of buttons was randomized across all\n120 trials. (b) Within each subject, the laser intensity was calibrated to match the in-\ndividual pain threshold.\n\n\n\n1164 K.H. Brodersen et al. / NeuroImage 63 (2012) 1162\u20131170\nthe laser stimulus was about to target a \u2018low threat\u2019 or a \u2018high threat\u2019\nsite.\n\nData acquisition and preprocessing\n\nUsing a 3T MRI scanner (Oxford Magnet Technology, Oxford, UK),\nwhole-brain functional T2*-weighted echo-planar images (EPI) were\nacquired with BOLD contrast (TR 3 s; TE 30 ms; flip angle 90\u00b0; matrix\n64\u00d764; field of view 192 mm\u00d7192 mm; 41 axial slices; slice thickness\n3 mm). The first 4 volumes were discarded to compensate for T1 satu-\nration effects. Using SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), images\nwere realigned to the first volume and unwarped. Images of all sessions\nwere spatially normalized to the standard EPI template included in\nSPM, using a fourth-degree B-spline interpolation.\n\nUnivariate analysis\n\nPrior to the classification-based analyses described below, we\nperformed several conventional univariate analyses for comparison.\nFor these analyses, images were spatially smoothed with an isotropic\nGaussian kernel (FWHM8 mm). First, we investigated themain effect of\npain during anticipation and stimulation. To this end, we constructed a\n(first-level) GLM for each subject with a design matrix that included\nseparate \u2018pain\u2019 and \u2018no pain\u2019 regressors for the anticipation and the stim-\nulation period (4 regressors), collapsing across \u2018low threat\u2019 and \u2018high\nthreat\u2019 trials, whose distinction was of no interest in the present study.\nAnticipation periods were modeled according to their trial-specific du-\nrations (i.e., 4\u20138 s), while the stimulus duration was modeled as 1 s. Se-\nrial autocorrelation and low-frequency drifts were accounted for using a\nfirst-order autoregressive model and a high-pass filter (cut-off 128 s),\nrespectively. Group-level inferences for the anticipation and stimulation\nperiod were made by entering the appropriate contrast into an ANOVA,\nusing the following two contrasts: (1) pain vs. no pain during anticipa-\ntion; and (2) pain vs. no pain during stimulation.\n\nMultivariate analysis\n\nIn contrast to univariate analyses, multivariate approaches explicitly\naccount for dependencies between voxels, which allows for inference\non distributed responses. In this study, we trained and tested a linear\nsupport vector machine (SVM) on trial-wise fMRI data. In order to\navoid a potential bias resulting from serial autocorrelations, we used\nleave-one-session-out cross-validation. Specifically, we trained an\nSVM on trials from three sessions and tested it on trials from the fourth\n(left-out) session, repeating this process four times. To obtain trial-wise\ndata for classification, we constructed a GLM with a design matrix that\nincluded separate boxcar regressors for the anticipation phase and the\nstimulation phase of each individual trial (240 regressors). We used\nthis GLM as a filter to obtain separate parameter-estimate images\n(beta images) for the anticipation phase and the stimulation phase of\neach trial. These images were processed further in two ways. First, we\nstandardized the parameter estimates within each voxel (implying\nmean=0 and standard deviation=1). Second, we scaled all images\nsuch that within each trial the l2-norm of parameter estimates became\n1. The resulting images were used in two sets of classification analyses,\nas described next (for a structured list of individual analysis steps, see\nSection C in the Supplemental Material).\n\nIn the first analysis, we investigated whether fMRI data contained\nsufficient information to predict, on a trial-by-trial basis, the perception\nof pain. For this purpose, a linear SVMwas trained and tested on differ-\nent anatomical scales. These independent analyses were based on\n(i) the single most discriminative voxel (which was determined using\na t-contrast as described in the second analysis below, and whose\nidentity was allowed to vary both between cross-validation folds and\nbetween subjects), (ii) combinations of discriminative voxels (i.e., dif-\nferently sized groups of voxels that were individually discriminative,\nas determined using a t-contrast as described below), (iii) single ana-\ntomical regions typically associated with pain processing (see below),\n(iv) combinations of the most predictive anatomical regions, and\n(v) whole-brain data.\n\nWithin each cross-validation fold, we used another (nested) level\nof (leave-one-trial-out) cross-validation on the training data to opti-\nmize the regularization hyperparameter C. In this way, test data were\nneither used for training nor for the optimization of hyperparameters,\nguaranteeing a non-circular analysis. Furthermore, to ensure that the\nanalysis was not confounded by differences between \u2018high threat\u2019 and\n\u2018low threat\u2019 trials, we ran two separate decoding analyses on the two\ntrial types and considered the mean accuracy. This procedure was re-\npeated for every subject to obtain an estimate of mean classification ac-\ncuracy in the group (cf. Section C in the Supplement).\n\nWe used a nonparametric permutation test to evaluate the null hy-\npothesis that there was no statistical link between fMRI data and the\nperception of pain. This null hypothesis corresponds to a mean popula-\ntion accuracy at the level of chance (i.e., 0.5). Thus, we repeated each\nclassification analysis N times using labels that were randomly permut-\ned within sessions, preserving the assumption of exchangeability\nunderlying the permutation test for our leave-one-session-out cross-\nvalidation scheme. For each analysis, we computed a p-value as: the\nrank of the original sample accuracy in the distribution of permutation-\nbased sample accuracies, divided by the number of permutations. We\ngenerally used N=1000. In the case of ROI-specific analyses with their\n26-fold multiple-comparison correction, we used N=2600 to allow for\nthe detection of significance at the 0.05 level (see below).\n\nIn the second analysis, we characterized the spatial deployment\nof jointly informative voxels across the brain by combining an SVM\nwith a permutation test on voxel weights (LaConte et al., 2005;\nMourao-Miranda et al., 2005). Specifically, we trained a linear SVM on\nwhole-brain data (using all 120 trials in each subject) and reconstructed\nthe spatial deployment of voxel-wise weight coefficients. These coeffi-\ncients may heavily depend on task-unrelated sources of variance in\nthe data and are generally not interpretable as such. One way of\naddressing this issue is to relate voxel weights to their empirical null\ndistributions, i.e., those distributions that one would obtain if no statis-\ntical relationship between BOLD activity and pain perception existed\n(Mourao-Miranda et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007).\n\nTo obtain these distributions, we randomly permuted trial-specific\nlabels and re-estimated the model based on the new labels. Unlike in\nthe case of all other multivariate analyses presented in this paper, a\nnonparametric permutation is computationally intractable if one\nwishes to obtain a whole-brain FWE-corrected map with fine-grained\ndiscriminability eve among top-scoring voxels. For this particular anal-\nysis, we therefore resorted to a parametric approach. Using a Kolmogo-\nrov\u2013Smirnov test (test size \u03b1=0.05), we found that less than 0.01% of\nall voxel-specific null distributions were not Gaussian. Thus, we sum-\nmarized each null distribution in terms of the mean and variance of a\nGaussian. Using these null distributions, we evaluated the probability\nwith which the weight wv in voxel v would have been observed under\nthe null. Formally, this test is based on a t-score, defined as\n\ntv \u00bc\nwv\u2212\u03bc\u0302 v\n\u03c3\u0302 v e\n\ntN\u22121;\n\nwhere \u03bc\u0302 v and \u03c3\u0302 v denote the sample mean and standard deviation of\nvoxel weights in voxel v across all random permutations, and tN\u22121\nis Student's t-distribution on N\u22121 degrees of freedom. We used N=\n2000 permutations and corrected the resulting map for multiple com-\nparisons using a conservativewhole-brain family-wise error (FWE) cor-\nrection (\u03b1=0.05). This correctionwas based on the same application of\nrandom-field theory to estimate the smoothness of the data aswas used\nfor thresholding the (mass-univariate) SPMs (see above).\n\nIn summary, we obtained whole-brain FWE-corrected maps of\nt-scores by relating voxel-wise SVM weights to their null distributions,\n\nhttp://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm\n\n\n1165K.H. Brodersen et al. / NeuroImage 63 (2012) 1162\u20131170\nas obtained by repeatedly re-estimating the model based on permuted\nlabels. In comparison to searchlight methods, this approach is of similar\ncomputational complexity but extends the search space from locally\nmultivariate patterns to jointly informative patterns across the entire\nbrain.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that maps of voxel weights come with\nmethodological limitations which may diminish their utility for draw-\ning conclusions about the encoding of pain. In particular, the regions\nthat are assigned the highest SVM weights may not necessarily be the\nregions that are most strongly related to pain responses. In addition,\nthe above t-scores are based on the assumption that voxel weights are\nnormally distributed under the null. Deviations from this assumption\nmay be particularly severe in the far tails of the distributions, leading\nto inaccuracies among high t-scores. Thus, the spatial deployment of\nfeature weights will serve illustrative purposes only, while conclusions\nabout the representation of pain will first and foremost be based on re-\ngional analyses of classification accuracy, as described next.\nRegion-of-interest analysis\n\nUsing published reference atlases (Harvard\u2013Oxford cortical and sub-\ncortical structural atlases, Harvard Center for Morphometric Analysis;\nJ\u00fclich Histological Atlas, Research Centre J\u00fclich) and individual T1 im-\nages, we defined 26 masks for pain-related brain regions (see Fig. S1\nand Section B in the Supplemental material). We trained and tested a\nlinear SVM independently on these ROIs and evaluated the resulting\nperformance in the sameway as described before (using nonparametric\npermutation tests; see \u2018Multivariate analysis\u2019). Since this analysis was\ncarried out independently for each ROI, we controlled the family-wise\nerror by correcting significance thresholds for multiple testing using a\nconservative Bonferroni correction based on the number of regions. In\norder to reduce the potentially confounding effect of smoothing on\nthe comparison between voxel-based and ROI-based feature selection,\nwe used a smaller smoothing kernel (FWHM 5 mm) in these analyses.\na Decoding pain during anticipation  (p < 0.05 FWE)\n\nb Decoding pain during stimulation  (p < 0.05 FWE)\n\noverall \naccuracy\n\n58%\n\noverall\naccuracy \n\n61%\n\nnon-painful\n\n\u20135.09\u20138 +5.09\n\nt\n\nLR\n\n122\u20138\u201318\u201328\n\nFig. 2.

We found that whole-brain activity both before (57.6%) and\nduring (61.4%) the application of a near-threshold laser stimulus\nenabled predictions significantly above chance level (pb0.001; non-\nparametric permutation test using N=1000 permutations).\n\nFor completeness, we tested which subjects showed effects that\nwere significant even when considered in isolation (see Supplemental\nFig. S1).We found that 1 out of 16 subjects by itself showed an accuracy\nthat was significantly above chance in the anticipation phase, and 3 out\nof 16 in the stimulation phase (pb0.05; nonparametric permutation\ntest using N=1000; Bonferroni-corrected).\n\nThough not of interest in the present study, we also examined\nwhether the condition (\u2018threat\u2019 vs. \u2018no threat\u2019) could be predicted\nfrom trial-wise fMRI data, in particular in the anticipation phase in\nwhich the condition was disclosed on the screen; we obtained mean\nclassification accuracies of 55.7% (pb0.05) before and 52.2% (n.s.)\nduring the stimulation.\n\nIn order to provide an intuition about which data features were re-\nsponsible for above-chance accuracies in predicting pain, we exam-\nined the spatial deployment of voxels that played an important role\nin classification. To this end, we adopted an exploratory perspective\nand used an SVM with a permutation test on feature weights to\nmap discriminative information continuously throughout the brain.\nThis approach highlights those voxels that are most influential in\nshaping the separating hyperplane used by the SVM to distinguish be-\ntween painful and non-painful trials (Fig. 2).

Brodersen et al. / NeuroImage 63 (2012) 1162\u20131170\nWe found that in the anticipation period, the bilateral insula\nproved most predictive for the perception of pain. In the stimulation\nperiod, brain activity in the mid cingulate cortex (MCC), SI/SII, bilater-\nal insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) allowed for significant predic-\ntions of the perception of pain (for a comparison with a conventional\nmass-univariate map, see Fig. S2 in the Supplemental material).\n\nDecoding pain from individual regions of interest\n\nHaving predicted pain perception based onwhole-brain activity, we\nnext asked whether it is possible to predict pain perception based on\nfMRI activity within individual brain regions. To investigate this, we\nattempted to decode the anticipation and perception of pain from 26\npredefined brain areas typically reported in the context of pain (plus 2\ncontrol areas). It should be noted that these regions were defined a\npriori on anatomical grounds, independently from the results of the\nabovewhole-brain analysis. We assessed the importance of each region\nin terms of the significance withwhich it enabled above-chance predic-\ntions. This approach allowed us to propose a rank order of pain-related\nregions. Critically, this rank order is based on significance rather than\naccuracy, and thus takes into account not only the mean accuracy but\nalso its between-subjects variability (Fig. 3).\n\nIt should be noted that the whole-brain analysis in the previous\nsection and the region-of-interest analysis in this section are based\non different notions of involvement. Thus, one would expect their re-\nsults to share the most important, but not necessarily all, characteris-\ntics. We will expand on this point in the Discussion.\n\nOf all brain regions commonly associated with the perception of\npain, our analysis revealed that only a subset was predictive of pain\non a trial-by-trial basis. The most predictive regions during the anti-\ncipation period were the right and left periaqueductal gray (PAG)\nand right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; all pb0.05; permutation test\nusing N=2600; Bonferroni-corrected for multiple testing across\nROIs; Fig. 3a).

In\nterms of magnitudes, in the anticipation period, the highest classifica-\ntion accuracy was afforded by the right PAG, while the most accurate\npredictions for the stimulation period were enabled by activity in the\nleft SI. By contrast, no above-chance performance was obtained when\nusing gray-matter control masks of regions not involved in pain pro-\ncessing (left and right Heschl's gyrus, HG.L and HG.R).\n\nIt should be kept in mind that all of the above numbers are sample\naccuracies which serve as estimates of their corresponding unknown\npopulation mean accuracies. The uncertainty associated with these\nestimates (i.e., their standard error) is non-negligible since it reflects\nthe between-subjects variability in the population (i.e., random ef-\nfects). The rank order of regions is particularly sensitive to this vari-\nability and should therefore only be interpreted as an approximate\nguide to true differences in regional informativeness.\n\nOnefinding, perhaps surprising atfirst,was the lack of above-chance\nprediction accuracy obtained in the signal of the mid and posterior\ninsula during stimulation. Thiswould be in contrast to previousfindings\nin which both insula subdivisions have been implicated in\nstimulus-dependent processing (Albanese et al., 2007; Raij et al.,\n2005; Singer et al., 2004). The posterior insula in particular is consid-\nered a key region for nociceptive processing (Oertel et al., 2011). It is\nconceivable that this seeming discrepancy is a result of the way in\nwhich our anatomical maskswere defined. As highlighted before, all re-\ngions of interest were defined on the basis of anatomical landmarks, not\nfunctional contrasts, and all voxels within a given area entered the re-\nspective multivariate analysis. Some regions, such as the posterior\ninsula, are known to be somatotopically organized (Brooks et al.,\n2005), suggesting that predictions from the entire region might not\nfaithfully reflect the impact of a particular somatotopically relevant sub-\nregion. Under this view, the surprisingly low accuracies in the posterior\ninsula might be a consequence of the functional heterogeneity across\nanatomical subdivisions included in our anatomical mask.\n\nWe tested this hypothesis in an additional post-hoc analysis in\nwhich we utilized results from a previous study investigating the\n50% 52% 54% 56% 58% 60%\n\nHG.R\nPAG.R\n\nPI.L\nHG.L\n\nPAG.L\nPI.R\nMI.L\n\nrACC.R\nAMYG.R\n\nrACC.L\ndACC.R\n\nMI.R\nAI.L\n\nTHA.L\ndACC.L\n\nSII.L\nAMYG.L\n\nVLPFC.R\nTHA.R\nOFC.L\nOFC.R\n\nVLPFC.L\nDLPFC.L\nDLPFC.R\n\nSII.R\nAI.R\nSI.R\nSI.L\n\nb Decoding pain during stimulation\n\nuracy +/\u2013s.e.m.\n\ns obtained in 26 regions of interest for the differentiation between trials experienced as\nnd HG.R).

Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the prediction accu-\nracy obtained in foot-specific portions of the (left) posterior insula\nwas not significantly above chance during the stimulation period.\nComparison of different spatial scales\n\nAs indicated above, activity patterns in several pain-related regions\nallow for the prediction of pain, both during anticipation and during\nstimulation. However, this does not necessarily imply that predictions\nbecome evenmore accurate when considering several brain regions si-\nmultaneously. To investigatewhether thismight be the case, we carried\nout two additional analyses in which we examined increasing spatial\nscales of encoding.\n\nIn the first analysis, we focused on pain-related brain regions and\ntested whether prediction accuracies would benefit from increasing\nthe search space (i.e., increasing the potential complexity of the\nmodel) from the most predictive single region to combinations of\nmultiple regions (Fig. 4). In the anticipation period, the most predictive\nsingle ROI (i.e., the right PAG) yielded a prediction accuracy of 56%\n(pb0.01; nonparametric permutation test using N=1000; Fig. 4a). We\nfound that this accuracy increased continuously when jointly consider-\ning additional regions and reached a significantly higher level (pb0.05;\nN=1000) when using the five most predictive regions (i.e., PAG, OFC,\nand right amygdala). Following this, the inclusion of additional regions\ndid not yield further improvements in prediction accuracy, suggesting\nthat the activation patterns in small combinations of regions, such as\nthese five, encode sufficient complementary information to predict the\nperception of pain. Similarly, we observed no (significant) further im-\nprovement in prediction accuracy by moving to a whole-brain analysis.\n50% 55% 60%\n\nwhole brain\n\npain matrix\n\n+DLPFC.R\n\n+SII.R\n\n+AI.R\n\nSI.L\n\nprediction accuracy +/\u2013s.e.m.\n\nanticipation\n\nb stimulation\n\n50% 55% 60%\n\nwhole brain\n\npain matrix\n\n+AMYG.R\n\n+OFC.L\n\n+PAG.L\n\n+OFC.R\n\nPAG.R\n\n*\n\nn.s.\n\n*\n\nn.s.\n\n+SI.R\n\na\n\nFig. 4.

Results are given in terms of mean accuracy +/\u2212 standard error of the mean. All\naccuracies are significantly above chance (pb0.01; nonparametric permutation test;\nN=1000). Additional significances are indicated between accuracies on different sets\nof regions (*pb0.05; permutation test).\nThese findings agreed nicely with the results that emerged from our\nanalysis of the stimulation period. While being exposed to a stimulus,\npain predictions from left SI, which was the most significant region,\nreached an accuracy of 59% (pb0.01; nonparametric permutation test\nusing N=1000). Predictions from the combination of left SI and other\nbrain regions that allowed for prediction of pain when considered in\nisolation (i.e., right SI, AI, SII, and DLPFC) did not lead to a significant in-\ncrease in prediction accuracy. However, adding in the entire \u2018pain ma-\ntrix\u2019 yielded a significant increase (pb0.05; N=1000) in prediction\naccuracy (to 62%) (Fig. 4b). This observation indicates that, while the\noverall accuracy is still well below 100%, the joint activation pattern of\nregions commonly summarized as the \u2018pain matrix\u2019 might enable the\nbest predictions about pain perception that can be made on the basis\nof fMRI activity measures. Thus, both in the anticipation phase and in\nthe stimulation phase, accuracies reached an optimum on the basis of\na set of anatomical regions, with no further improvement enabled by\nconsidering whole-brain activity.\n\nIn the second analysis, we examined a search space that was not\nbased on anatomical regions of interest; instead, we considered indi-\nvidual voxels without anatomical constraints. We began with the sin-\ngle most predictive voxel, then tripled the number of voxels in each\nstep, until the search space corresponded to a whole-brain analysis.\nVoxel-wise predictive strength was measured, independently within\neach cross-validation fold, in terms of t-scores, using a between-\nconditions two-tailed t-test. Using these discriminative scores, we\nfound that the resulting prediction accuracies increased near-\nmonotonically with the number of voxels considered, both in the an-\nticipation and in the stimulation period, and leveled off towards the\nend (Fig. 5). Prediction of pain from the anticipation period increased\nfrom 52% (using a single voxel) to 58% (using all voxels; significantly\nabove chance, pb0.001; nonparametric permutation test; N=1000).\nFor the stimulation period, this accuracy increased from 54% (using\na single voxel) to 61% (using all voxels, pb0.001; N=1000). Critically,\nthe most rapid increase in accuracy was observed at small voxel num-\nbers, while subsequent additions made very little contributions com-\npared to the number of additional model parameters.\n\nOverall, using a whole-brain search for the most informative\nvoxels yielded higher prediction accuracies than the combinations\nof anatomical regions analyzed before. One might ask, of course,\nwhether the two approaches could be compared on a finer scale.\n45%\n\n50%\n\n55%\n\n60%\n\nnumber of voxels\n30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 whole \n\nbrain\n\nmost informative voxels\nanatomical ROIs\n\nmost informative voxels\nanatomical ROIs\n\nanticipation\n\nstimulation\nchance\n\np\nre\n\nd\nic\n\ntio\nn\n a\n\ncc\nu\nra\n\ncy\n +\n\n/\u2013\n s\n\n.e\n.m\n\n.\n\nFig. 5.

Brodersen et al. / NeuroImage 63 (2012) 1162\u20131170\nHere, we imported the results from Fig. 4 into Fig. 5. Specifically, for\neach ROI result shown in Fig. 4, we determined the corresponding po-\nsition on the x-axis in Fig. 5 based on the region's number of voxels\n(averaged across subjects) and plotted its corresponding accuracy.\nWe found that anatomical feature selection performed surprisingly\nwell although it never significantly outperformed voxel selection\nbased on the t-contrast.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present study employed a multivariate decoding approach\n(i) to predict experiences of near-threshold pain from brain activity\nduring the anticipation and receipt of pain, and (ii) to examine the\ndistributed nature of pain perception. Our analysis led to three main\nfindings.\n\nFirst, we confirmed that it is possible to decode the perception of\npain from trial-wise whole-brain fMRI data, even in the absence of\nphysical stimulus alterations. In other words, we have demonstrated\nthe existence of a subtle yet highly significant statistical link between\nmeasures of brain activity and pain perception. Second, while most\nbrain regions commonly associated with pain allowed for above-\nchance decoding, these regions differed with regard to their predic-\ntive accuracy. Our analysis yielded a possible rank order of brain re-\ngions in which those regions turned out as most predictive that are\ngenerally considered critical for cognitive-affective pain processing\nor for sensory processing. Third, we found that fMRI activity on differ-\nent spatial scales enabled different degrees of accuracy with which in-\nformation about perceptions of pain can be decoded from fMRI data.\nRegarding the balance between accuracy (of the predictions) and\ncomplexity (of the model), a small set of anatomical regions of inter-\nest provided better explanations of subjective decisions about pain\nthan individual voxels or individual regions.\n\nOn the feasibility of predicting pain from brain activity\n\nMultivariate analyses have been used to assess the predictability\nof a perceptual state from fMRI data in various contexts. The majority\nof existing studies have used classification algorithms to decode the\nidentity of a physical stimulus (Haynes and Rees, 2006; Norman et\nal., 2006; O'Toole et al., 2007), where classifier predictions can be ver-\nified on the basis of the experimental design. First steps towards a dif-\nferent logic have been made by two recent methodological studies.\nOne of them illustrated the utility of Gaussian processes by predicting\nboth the identity of physically different stimuli and subjective re-\nsponses to pain stimuli from the same class of intensity (Marquand\net al., 2010). Another one explored the temporal evolution of the per-\nceived intensity of prolonged pain stimulation (Prato et al., 2011).\n\nIn the present study, we focused specifically on the logic of\nconstant-stimulus paradigms by using a design in which stimuli\nwere calibrated to meet each subject's individual pain-detection\nthreshold. In the absence of physical alterations in stimulus input,\nthe perception of pain can only be assessed by introspection. This\nmeans that differences in neural activity reflect different sensations\nof pain in response to a constant stimulation level. We found that,\neven when using near-threshold stimuli that make decoding maxi-\nmally difficult, a \u2018fingerprint\u2019 of activity can be detected with fMRI\nthat is sufficiently clear to enable above-chance prediction of pain\nperception both before and during stimulation.\n\nPredictive brain regions and spatial scales\n\nIn our analysis of brain regions commonly associated with the per-\nception of pain we found that, in isolation, not all areas allowed for\nabove-chance predictions. When decoding pain perception from\npre-stimulus activity, significant accuracies were mostly afforded by\nthe PAG and OFC (Fig. 3a). Both regions have been linked to affective\nprocessing, particularly in the context of fear and anxiety (McNally et\nal., 2011; Milad and Rauch, 2007). By comparison, above-chance pre-\ndictions during the stimulation period were enabled by a larger set of\nbrain regions (Fig. 3b), in particular: sensory areas (i.e., primary and\nsecondary somatosensory cortex; Hofbauer et al., 2001; Raij et al.,\n2004; Singer et al., 2004); and regions involved in cognitive-\naffective pain processing (e.g., anterior insula; Ploner et al., 2010), in-\ncluding those implicated in top\u2013downmodulation of pain (i.e., DLPFC,\nVLPFC; Wiech et al., 2008).\n\nAn important aspect of multivariate analyses is that the signifi-\ncance afforded by an individual region is not equivalent to its impor-\ntance in the context of a whole-brain feature space. For example, a\nregion might provide no additional information when considered\nalong with all other voxels in the brain, yet enable significant classifi-\ncation accuracies when considered in isolation. In other words, the\nwhole-brain analysis and the region-of-interest analysis described\nin this paper are based on different notions of involvement; both\nare worthwhile studying. Thus, while one would expect a large de-\ngree of agreement between the two analyses, this need not necessar-\nily be so. Indeed, we found that regions showing up in our whole-\nbrain analyses (Fig. 2) typically (but not always) also afforded highly\nsignificant classification accuracies when considered in isolation in\nthe region-of-interest analysis, and vice versa (Fig. 3). For example,\nwhile the anterior insula showed up in the map for anticipation, its\naccuracy was not above chance; conversely, while the left OFC did\nnot show up in the whole-brain map for the anticipation phase, its ac-\ncuracy was above chance in the region-of-interest analysis.\n\nOur analysis of distributed activity across spatial scales showed\nthat, both before and during stimulation, the joint activation pattern\nin collections of discriminative regions afforded significantly more ac-\ncurate predictions than any of these regions by themselves, while\nbeing insignificantly less accurate than predictions made on the\nbasis of whole-brain data. This result was consistent with our analysis\nat the scale of individual voxels. In this analysis, we found that accu-\nracies increased quickly with the inclusion of very few initial voxels,\nbut that this increase slowed down considerably as more and more\nvoxels were added (Fig. 5). Taken together, these findings suggest\nthat a multidimensional experience such as pain perception can\nonly be understood by considering a distributed representation of ac-\ntivity in the brain. The highest accuracies may only be achieved when\nconsidering the entire pain matrix or indeed whole-brain activity; but\nmost of the increase in accuracy is observed at the spatial scale of just\na few regions of interest.\n\nIn summary, the multivariate analyses carried out in the present\nstudy provided two major findings that complement previous mass-\nunivariate investigations. First, they suggest that only a subset of\nso-called \u2018pain matrix\u2019 regions, when considered in isolation, exhibit\na distributed representation of activity across intra-areal voxels that\nallows for trial-wise predictions of near-threshold pain. This is in\nline with several recent studies in which large parts of the \u2018pain ma-\ntrix\u2019 were suggested not to be pain-specific (Legrain et al., 2011;\nMouraux et al., 2011). At the same time, however, our simultaneous\nconsideration of the entire \u2018pain matrix\u2019 enabled a significantly higher\nprediction accuracy than the most predictive region by itself (Fig. 4b).\nThis finding suggests that the \u2018pain matrix\u2019 as a whole carries infor-\nmation that might reflect the complexity of pain. As a second princi-\npal finding, our hierarchically structured analyses across multiple\nscales (from single regions via sets of regions to whole brain) indicate\nthat decoding of pain perception from fMRI data is most adequately\ndone at an intermediate spatial scale by considering the joint activity\nof a few core regions.\n\nMultivariate analyses in basic pain research and in practical applications\n\nThe results obtained in this study must be viewed in light of an im-\nportant conceptual difference between cognitive neuroscience on the\n\n\n\n1169K.H. Brodersen et al. / NeuroImage 63 (2012) 1162\u20131170\none hand and engineering applications, such as those found in brain\u2013\nmachine interfaces, on the other (cf. Friston et al., 2008). Neuroscience\nis typically concerned with the demonstration of structure-function re-\nlationships in the brain, which is formally carried out usingmodel com-\nparison (by comparing, for instance, the evidence of a model that links\ndistributed fMRI data to pain perception to a model that does not).\nThis means the quantity of interest is the significance with which a\ngiven prediction accuracy is above chance. Engineering applications\nand tools for automated diagnostics, by contrast, is typically concerned\nwith questions of practical sufficiency (or substantive significance) and\nmay therefore be more interested in, for example, the absolute classifi-\ncation accuracy that can be achieved in decoding a brain state from fMRI\n(e.g., Brodersen et al., 2011).\n\nIf one were to adopt an engineering perspective for a moment, it\nwould be sobering to observe that even the best predictive accuracies\nobtained in this study were far fromwhat could be considered satisfac-\ntory for most real-world applications. In part, this must be attributed to\nthe fact that our near-threshold paradigmwas designed to force our al-\ngorithm to rely on the subtle activity patterns encoding a purely subjec-\ntive experience rather than physical differences in stimulus strength.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind that the conclusions drawn\nfrom the application of any given statistical model (such as a general\nlinear model or a support vector machine) are necessarily conditional\non the assumptions of that model. This means that overall accuracies,\nthe spatial deployment of informative regions, or the rank order of re-\ngions of interest are not independent of the specific characteristics of\nthe underlying classification algorithm (such as a linear support vec-\ntor machine). Thus, observing a low overall classification accuracy\ncould in principle simply be the result of a suboptimal classification\nmodel.\n\nThe purpose of the present study, however, is not to provide a\ndecoding algorithm that fulfills the requirements of a practically use-\nful \u2018brain-reading\u2019 device of some sort. Instead, our ambition is to ex-\namine the distributed nature of structure-function mappings in the\nbrain, which relies on the significance of accuracies, not on their mag-\nnitude. This is also the reason why we used the simplest and most\nnatural classification scheme, that is, trial-by-trial classification. If\none were to design an algorithm for practical prediction tasks, one\nmight hope to achieve higher accuracies by averaging trials across\nseveral repetitions of the same trial type (Davatzikos et al., 2005).\n\nIn the general public, neuroimaging technologies are occasionally\nportrayed as tools that might provide an objective readout for subjec-\ntive phenomena that cannot be accessed otherwise. There is indeed a\npronounced need for such brain-reading tools in a legal context,\nwhere the proof of presence or absence of pain can be critical to the\nverdict about compensation claims (Miller, 2009). Our findings sug-\ngest that decoding of pain based on fMRI data may be possible. How-\never, as discussed above, even the highest classification accuracies\nobtained in this study were a long way from perfect decoding. Fur-\nthermore, the prediction of pain for a particular individual was\nbased on information obtained from the same individual (albeit\nfrom independent data). In a legal context, by contrast, the prediction\nof pain in one individual should be afforded based on information ac-\nquired in a norm collective. Although first attempts to classify across\nsubjects have been made (e.g., Schulz et al., 2011), this approach in-\nevitably carries the risk of neglecting individual peculiarities, espe-\ncially in highly sensitive contexts such as pain perception. The\npotential utility of fMRI for the decoding of pain in a legal context\nmust therefore be considered with great caution. At the same time,\nthe underlying multivariate methods are highly useful for basic neu-\nroscience and may eventually yield important clinical applications.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research was supported by the Wellcome Trust (FMRIB Cen-\ntre and IT), by the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (KW),\nby the University Research Priority Program \u2018Foundations of Human\nSocial Behaviour\u2019 at the University of Zurich (KHB, KES), by the\nSystemsX.ch project \u2018Neurochoice\u2019 (KHB, KES), and by the NCCR \u2018Neu-\nral Plasticity\u2019 (KES).

Despite numerous previous fMRI studies,however, it remains open which spatial distribution of activity is suf\ufb01cient to encode whether a stimulus is per-ceived as painful or not. In this study, we analyzed fMRI data from a perceptual decision-making task in whichparticipants were exposed to near-threshold laser pulses. Using multivariate analyses on different spatial scales,we investigated the predictive capacity of fMRI data for decoding whether a stimulus had been perceived as pain-ful. Our analysis yielded a rank order of brain regions: during pain anticipation, activity in the periaqueductalgray (PAG) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) afforded the most accurate trial-by-trial discrimination between pain-ful and non-painful experiences; whereas during the actual stimulation, primary and secondary somatosensorycortex, anterior insula, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and OFC were most discriminative. Themost accurate prediction of pain perception from the stimulation period, however, was enabled by the combinedactivity in pain regions commonly referred to as the \u2018pain matrix\u2019. Our results demonstrate that the neural rep-resentation of (near-threshold) pain is spatially distributed and can be best described at an intermediate spatialscale. In addition to its utility in establishing structure-function mappings, our approach affords trial-by-trial pre-dictions and thus represents a step towards the goal of establishing an objective neuronal marker of painperception."}
