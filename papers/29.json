The\nunderstanding of the underlying physical mechanisms is still not clear, and modeling of\nthem is very limited. In this paper, a holistic mathematical model for quantifying skin ther-\nmal pain sensation is developed. The model is composed of three interconnected parts:\nperipheral modulation of noxious stimuli, which converts the energy from a noxious ther-\nmal stimulus into electrical energy via nerve impulses; transmission, which transports\nthese neural signals from the site of transduction in the skin to the spinal cord and brain;\nand modulation and perception in the spinal cord and brain. With this model, a direct rela-\ntionship is built between the level of thermal pain sensation and the character of noxious\nstimuli.\n\n\ufffd 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nSkin is the largest single organ of the body. It consists of several layers and plays a variety of important roles including\nsensory, thermoregulatory and host defense etc. However, in an extreme environment, an uncomfortable feeling or pain sen-\nsation is evoked due to heat or cold: the skin fails to protect the body when the temperature lies outside of the normal phys-\niological range. In medicine, with advances in laser, microwave and similar technologies, various thermal therapeutic\nmethods have been developed recently and widely used to cure disease/injury involving skin tissue; but the corresponding\nproblem of pain relief has limited the further application and development of these thermal treatments.\n\nAs one of the most important sensations, pain has been long studied over a range of scales, from the molecular level (ion\nchannel) to the entire human neural system level. Thermal stimulation, as one of the three main pain stimulators (thermal,\nmechanical and chemical), has been widely used in the study of pain, as in the examination of tissue injury and sensitisation\nmechanisms, and in the quantification of therapeutic effects due to pharmacological, physical, and psychological interven-\ntions. However, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms is still far from clear. One reason is that pain is influenced\nby many factors, including physiological, such as stimulus intensity and duration, and psychological factors such as attention\nand empathy.\n\nThe utilization of computational models in the field of pain has been very limited, with previous attempts at pain mod-\neling focusing mainly on acute pain. There are nonetheless strong arguments for mathematical modeling [1,2], it can handle\nextremely complex theories and can be used to predict behaviors which have perhaps previously gone unnoticed. The meth-\nod is also non-invasive. Several mathematical models have been developed at different levels: at the molecular level and cel-\nlular level [1,3\u20139]; and at the level of neuron network [10,11]. None of these models have correlated the external stimulus\nparameters directly with the pain sensation level, and no transmission process has been considered. For example, the \u2018\u2018gate\ncontrol theory\u201d has been used to extrapolate the relevant features of pain and has been translated into a mathematical model\n.

Xu et al. / Applied Mathematics and Computation 205 (2008) 37\u201346\nby Britton and Skevington [1,7\u20139], but it only considers the perception and modulation processes of pain sensation at spinal\ncord and brain, without considering the transduction process occurring within the skin tissue. These issues are addressed in\nthis study.\n\nThe focus of this paper is placed upon the superficial nociceptive acute pain. Neuropathic pain and chronic pain as well as\npsychological factors that influence the pain are not modeled at present stage. In the following sections, the mechanisms of\nskin thermal pain are first described with emphasis on the transduction function of skin nociceptors; the development of the\nmodel is presented next; finally, a simple case of surface heating is used for the preliminary analysis of thermal pain.\n\n2. Skin thermal pain\n\nThe physiology of pain has been studied extensively and a detailed description of the current understanding on this sub-\nject can be found in [12\u201315]. The pain pathway is schematically shown in Fig. 1 and can be simply described as: (1) trans-\nduction: when a stimulus is applied to the skin, the nociceptors located there will trigger action potentials by converting the\nphysical energy from a noxious thermal, mechanical, or chemical stimulus into electrochemical energy; (2) transmission: the\nsignals are then transmitted in the form of action potential chains (similar to pulse trains) via nerve fibers from the site of\ntransduction (periphery) to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, which then activates the associated transmission neuron; (3)\nperception: the appreciation of signals arriving in higher structures as pain; (4) modulation: descending inhibitory and facil-\nitory input from the brain that influences (modulates) nociceptive transmission at the level of the spinal cord.\n\n2.1. Nociceptors in skin tissue\n\nNociceptors, the special receptor for pain sensation, are the first cells in the series of neurons leading to the sensation of\nnociceptive pain. Nociceptors transduct mechanical, chemical and/or thermal energy to ionic current (noxious stimuli into\ndepolarizations that trigger action potentials), conduct the action potentials from the peripheral sensory site to the synapse\nin the central nervous system, and convert the action potentials into neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal\n(frequency modulation) [16]. Nociceptors in skin are generally one of three kinds of peripheral nerves: myelinated afferent\nAd fibers and Aa fibers, as well as unmyelinated C afferent fibers, while thermal pain sensations are mediated mainly by both\nthin myelinated Ad- and unmyelinated C-fibers [17]. Many unmyelinated C-fibers can be traced far into the epidermal layer.\nThe study of myelinated mechanical nociceptor endings in cat hairy skin showed that the free nerve endings of pain recep-\ntors exist around the depth of 50 lm [18], while the receptor depth in the hairy skin of monkeys estimated from responses to\nramped stimuli ranged from 20 to 570 lm with a mean of 201 lm [19,20].\nFig. 1. Schematic of the holistic skin thermal pain model.\n\n\n\nF. Xu et al. / Applied Mathematics and Computation 205 (2008) 37\u201346 39\n2.2. Ion channels of nociceptors\n\nAll the essential functions of nociceptors depend on ion channels [12,16], including heat activated channels, capsaicin\nreceptors, ATP-gated channels, proton-gated channels or acid-sensing channels, nociceptor-specific voltage-gated Na+ chan-\nnels, mechanosensitive channels, etc. In spite of these different channels, they are generally gated by three different meth-\nods, namely, thermal (hot or cold), mechanical, and chemical, with thresholds of \ufffd43 \ufffdC and \ufffd0.2 MPa for the first two,\nrespectively. When a noxious stimulus is applied to a nociceptor (larger than the threshold), the corresponding ion channels\nwill be opened, resulting in a current, thereby triggering the action potential.\n\n3. Model development\n\nAccording to the above description of pain pathway, a holistic model of skin thermal pain is developed in this section that\nis composed of three sub-models: model of transduction, model of transmission, and model of perception and modulation.\nThe schematic of the holistic model is shown in Fig. 1. The details of each sub-model are given below.\n\n3.1. Model of transduction\n\n3.1.1. Thermomechanical model of skin tissue\nIt is now accepted that thermal pain is determined by the temperature at the location of nociceptors, not at the skin sur-\n\nface. When the skin is heated to a temperature beyond the threshold (\ufffd43 \ufffdC), thermal damage of skin tissue begins accu-\nmulate. The thermal damage causes cells to break down, releasing a number of tissue byproducts and mediators, which will\nactivate and sensitize the nociceptors. Furthermore, thermally induced stresses due to non-uniform temperature distribu-\ntions may also lead to the sensation of thermal pain, in addition to the pain generated by heating alone. Supporting evidence\nshows that, for the same level of nociceptor activity, a heat stimulus evokes more pain than a mechanical stimulus, and that\ntissue deformation due to heating and cooling may explain the origins of pain [21,22]. A thermomechanical model of skin\ntissue has been developed in our previous study [23]. The skin is treated as a layered \u2013 \u2018\u2018laminated\u201d \u2013 material according\nto its real structure, whose overall properties are assembled in a composite manner, as shown in Fig. 2. Its thermomechanical\nbehavior is simplified as a \u2018sequentially coupled\u2019 problem, in other words, the mechanical and thermal properties are inde-\npendent of each other. Solutions of the temperature, thermal damage and thermal stress fields are given next.\n\n3.1.1.1. Temperature profile. The temperature field can be obtained by solving the bioheat transfer model of skin tissue. For\nexample, for a one-layer skin model under surface contact heating at temperature Ts, the closed-form solution of tempera-\nture at the location of nociceptor, Tn, can be obtained as [23]:\nTn\u00f0zn; t\u00de \u00bc T0\u00f0zn\u00de \u00fe\n2a\nH\n\nTs \ufffd k\ndT0\u00f0zn\u00de\n\ndzn\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\nz\u00bc0\n\n\ufffd \ufffdX1\nm\u00bc1\n\nbm sin\u00f0bm\u00f0zn \u00fe H\u00de\u00de\n1\n\nab2m \u00fe\n-bqbcb\n\nqc\n\n1\ufffd e\ufffdab\n2\nmt\ufffd\n\n-bqbcb\nqc t\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere T0\u00f0z\u00de is initial temperature field in the tissue with z \u00bc 0 corresponding to skin surface; q, c, k are the density, specific\nheat and thermal conductivity of skin tissue, respectively; qb, cb are the density and specific heat of blood, -b is the blood\nFig. 2.

Current\nAs previously discussed, the pain signal starts from the current induced by the opening of ion channels in nociceptors.\n\nSince ion channels are generally gated by three different methods (thermal, mechanical and chemical), there are correspond-\ningly three different currents. The total current can be calculated as:\nIst \u00bc Iheat \u00fe Ichem \u00fe Imech: \u00f05\u00de\nThe heat current, Iheat, is assumed to be a function of nociceptor temperature, Tn, and thermal pain threshold, Tt , given as:\nIheat \u00bc fh\u00f0Tn; Tt\u00de: \u00f06\u00de\nHere, Tt is assumed to be 43 \ufffdC [24,25].\nThe chemical current, Ichem, is assumed to depend on the thermal damage degree of skin tissue, Deg:\nIchem \u00bc fc\u00f0Deg\u00de: \u00f07\u00de\nThe mechanical current, Imech, is assumed to be a function of the stress at the location of nociceptor, rn, and mechanical pain\nthreshold, rt:\nImech \u00bc fm\u00f0rn;rt\u00de; \u00f08\u00de\nwhere rt is assumed to be 0.2 MPa [26].\n\n3.1.3. Frequency modulation\nWhen the evocated current overpasses the threshold, an action potential is generated. It is now accepted that the inten-\n\nsity of external stimulation is carried through the frequency of these impulses, fs, not the exact magnitude or shape of the\nsignal, which can be calculated as:\nfs \u00bc ffm\u00f0Ist\u00de: \u00f09\u00de\nUnfortunately, there exists no study to quantify the current\u2013frequency relation. We need, therefore, to choose a model for\nthe generation of an action potential. Although there has been no relative analysis on nociceptor kinetics, all neurons have\nbeen found to behave qualitatively similar to that described by the Hodgkin\u2013Huxley (H\u2013H) model of nerve excitation [27].\nTherefore, the H\u2013H model is adopted here to model the frequency response of skin nociceptors. Mathematically, the H\u2013H\nmodel can be described as:\nCmem\ndVmem\n\ndt\n\u00bc Ist \u00fe gNam\n\n3h\u00f0ENa \ufffd Vmem\u00de \u00fe gKn\n4\u00f0EKNa \ufffd Vmem\u00de \u00fe gL\u00f0EL \ufffd Vmem\u00de; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere Vmem is the membrane potential (mV), which is positive when the membrane is depolarized and negative when the\nmembrane is hyperpolarized; ENa, EK and EL are the corresponding reversal potentials for sodium, potassium and leakage\ncurrent components, given by the Nernst equation (all in mV), respectively; gNa, gK and gL are the maximal ionic conductance\nthrough sodium, potassium and leakage current components (all in mS/cm2), respectively; t is time (ms); Cmem is membrane\ncapacity per unit area (lF/cm2); Ist is the stimulation-induced current density, as defined by Eq. (5), which is positive\n\n\n\nF.

Each of the three ionic currents (INa, IK and IL) is driven by an electrical potential difference and a permeability\ncoefficient, or conductance [27]. The conductances of the ionic currents are regulated by voltage dependent activation and\ninactivation variables, known as gating variables (m, n and h), which are given as [27]:\ndx\ndt\n\u00bc ax\u00f01\ufffd x\u00de \ufffd bxx: \u00f011\u00de\nHere, x can be either m, n and h, which are voltage- and time-dependent parameters; ax and bx are rate constants (in s\n\ufffd1). ax\n\nand bx can be approximated from experiments [27] as:\nan \u00bc\n\ufffd0:01\u00f0Vmem \u00fe 50\u00de\n\nexp\u00bd\ufffd\u00f0Vmem \u00fe 50\u00de=10\ufffd \ufffd 1\n; bn \u00bc 0:125 exp\n\n\ufffd\u00f0Vmem \u00fe 60\u00de\n80\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n; \u00f012\u00de\n\nam \u00bc\n\ufffd0:1\u00f0Vmem \u00fe 35\u00de\n\nexp\u00bd\ufffd\u00f0Vmem \u00fe 35\u00de=10\ufffd \ufffd 1\n; bm \u00bc 4 exp\n\n\ufffd\u00f0Vmem \u00fe 60\u00de\n18\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n; \u00f013\u00de\n\nah \u00bc 0:07 exp\n\ufffd\u00f0Vmem \u00fe 60\u00de\n\n20\n\n\ufffd \ufffd\n; bh \u00bc\n\n1\nexp\u00bd\ufffd\u00f0Vmem \u00fe 30\u00de=10\ufffd \u00fe 1:\n\n\u00f014\u00de\nHere, the various constants are obtained empirically from experimental data [27], given as: Cm \u00bc 1:0 lF=cm2, ENa \u00bc 55 mV,\nEK \u00bc \ufffd72 mV, xfac \u00bc 1, gNa \u00bc 120 mS=cm2, gK \u00bc 36 mS=cm2, gL \u00bc 0:3 mS=cm2.\n\n3.2. Model of transmission\n\nThis model simulates the transmission of noxious stimulus triggered neural signals from the skin along the respective\nfibers to spinal cord and brain. Since the stimulation intensity is carried through the firing rate, or frequency, of these im-\npulses, the actual shape, amplitude and duration of a single spike are not taken into account. The time for this transmission,\ntt , is obtained once the conduction velocity and the corresponding nerve length are determined.\n\n3.2.1. Nerve length \u00f0Ln\u00de\nFor simplicity, the present study only considers the case that the skin is subjected to a thermal loading restricted to a\n\nsmall area (i.e., localized stimuli). Consequently, all fibers connected with the skin nociceptors are postulated to have the\nsame length. Here, a length of 1 m is chosen, approximately the distance between a finger and the spinal cord [28]:\nLn \u00bc 1 m: \u00f015\u00de\n3.2.2. Conduction velocity \u00f0vc\u00de\nThe conduction velocity \u00f0vc\u00de is found to be directly related to fiber diameter \u00f0D\u00de [13]. A linear relationship between vc and\n\nD is assumed:\n\nvc \u00bc vcN \u00bc cdD; \u00f016\u00de\nwhere vcN is the conduction velocity under normal condition and cd is the coefficient between diameter and velocity.\nIn addition to fiber diameter, temperature also influences the nerve conduction velocity. For example, it has been found\n\nthat the conduction velocity is reduced in a cold environment and the rate of conduction velocity reduction is identical for\nslow and fast fibers [29,30]. Thus, the conduction velocity, considering temperature effect, can be calculated as:\nvc \u00bc vcT \u00bc cTvcN; \u00f017\u00de\nwhere vcT is the velocity when the fiber is in an environment of temperature T, cT is the influence factor of temperature on the\nconduction velocity: cT is given by Paintal [29,30], which was obtained from experiments using cat. Here it is assumed that\nthe resulting rules are also applicable to human peripheral nerves in view of their structural and functional similarities.\n\n3.2.3. Transmission time \u00f0tt\u00de\nOnce the nerve length and conduction velocity are known, the transmission time can be calculated as:\ntt \u00bc Ln=vc: \u00f018\u00de\n3.3. Model of modulation and perception\n\nThe theory of gate control [31] is employed here to describe the modulation and perception process of skin thermal pain.\nA schematic description of the theory is presented in Fig. 3. In general, it is the small fibers \u00f0c;Ad\u00de that carry information\nabout noxious stimuli whilst the role of large fibers \u00f0Ab\u00de is to carry information about less intense mechanical stimuli.

Results and discussion: case study\n\nFor illustration, the applicability of the developed holistic thermal pain model is illustrated using a simple surface heating\ncase. The skin surface initially at normal temperature of 37 \ufffdC is suddenly taken into contact with a hot source of constant\ntemperature (50 \ufffdC) for 20 s. Using the previous skin thermomechanical model, the temperature history of nociceptor is ob-\ntained first, which is then used as the input for the neural model. The nociceptors are assumed to be C fibers with a conduc-\ntion velocity of 1 m/s. The one-dimensional, three-layer skin model is used where effect of blood perfusion is only considered\nin the dermis layer. The relevant parameters of skin tissue used are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n4.1.

The predicted temperature history of the noci-\nceptor is shown in Fig. 5a, which is then used as the input for the pain model. The corresponding pain level is shown in\nFig. 5b. It is seen from Fig. 5 that, at the same stimulus intensity, the pain level is higher if the nociceptor is located closer\nto the surface of skin. This may be used to explain why different pain thresholds were obtained by different studies for the\nsame stimulus [19,20].\n\n\n\n0 5 10 15 20\n\n39\n\n42\n\n45\n\n48\n\n51\nT\n\ns\n= 50 \n\nO\nC\n\n     z\nn\n (\u03bcm)\n\n 20\n 50\n 100\n 200\n\nT\nn\n\n O\nC\n\nt (s)\n\nThreshold of nociceptor 43\nO\nC\n\n0 5 10 15 20\n-70\n\n-60\n\n-50\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\nV\nt\n (\n\nm\nv)\n\nt (s)\n\nTs= 50 \nO\nC\n\n     z\nn\n (\u03bcm)\n\n 20\n 50\n 100\n 200\n\nThreshold of pain -55 mV\n\n(a) Temperature history (b) Pain level \n\nFig. 5.

Influence of stimulus intensity\n\nNaturally, it is expected that the magnitude of skin surface temperature has a great effect on pain. Fig. 6 presents the noci-\nceptor temperature and pain level as functions of time for selected values of skin surface temperature. The corresponding\nrelationship between stimulus intensity and pain sensation is plotted in Fig. 7. A nearly linear relation stimulus intensity\nand pain level exists in the temperature range studied (45\u201350 \ufffdC; Fig. 7). Similar results have been observed in literature.\nFor example, LaMotte and Campbell [32] found that heat pain increases monotonically with stimulus intensity between\n40 and 50 \ufffdC whlist Torebjork et al. [33] observed a linear relationship between the mean responses of CMHs recorded in\nconscious humans and the median ratings of pain over the temperature range of 39\u201351 \ufffdC.\n\n5. Summary\n\nPreliminary results from theoretical modeling of skin thermal pain are presented. By considering the underlying biophys-\nical and neurological mechanisms of pain sensation, a holistic mathematical model for quantifying skin thermal pain is\ndeveloped. The model is composed of three interconnected parts: peripheral modulation of noxious stimuli, which converts\nthe energy from a noxious thermal stimulus into electrical energy via nerve impulses; transmission, which transports these\nneural signals from the site of transduction in the skin to the spinal cord and brain; and modulation and perception in the\nspinal cord and brain. In the model of modulation, a thermomechanical model of skin tissue is employed for the calculation\nof stimulus intensity at the location of nociceptor. With this model, the intensity of thermal pain can be predicted directly in\nterms of the character of noxious stimuli: as a corollary, for a given thermal treatment profile, a given medical procedure can\nbe determined to be painful or not.\n\nThere are nonetheless several limitations of the model, as described below. (1) In the model, the neurons are assumed to\nbe one point, whose numbers and real shape are not taken into account. We will therefore need to consider the actual mor-\nphology of the neuron. (2) The skin is assumed to be a thermo-elastic material although viscoelasticity has been shown to\nplay an important role in the mechanical behavior of skin [34\u201337] and touch sensation [38\u201341]. (3) The parameters used in\nour model are not initially obtained from experiments on nociceptors, which is due to the fact that there is no appropriate\nexperimental or theoretical data about skin nociceptors. These deficiencies of the model will be addressed in our future the-\noretical and experimental studies.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work is supported by the Overseas Research Studentship (ORS) and Overseas Trust Scholarship of Cambridge Univer-\nsity, the Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University Research Funding, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (10572111,\n10632060), the National 111 Project of China (B06024), and the National Basic Research Program of China (2006CB601202).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] N.F.
