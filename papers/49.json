The\nvalidity of a variety of pain intensity ratings has been\ninvestigated in numerous studies over the past few dec-\nades. Although pain intensity ratings scales have been\nvalidated, an emerging consensus warns that simple\npain ratings carry many hidden individualized mean-\nings for each particular patient rather than generaliz-\nable information about each specific sensation\n(Williams et al., 2000). Conceptually, pain descriptors\nand symptoms that they represent would seem to offer\nmore specific information. This is well recognized in the\nAssociation for the Study of Pain.

Behrman et al. / European Journal of Pain 11 (2007) 370\u2013376 371\nclinical arena, but it is yet to be proven that this infor-\nmation contributes to an improvement in pain assess-\nment, especially when attempts are made to utilize\nspecific pain descriptors for elucidation of underlying\nmechanisms. The development of specific question-\nnaires such as the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire\n(NPQ) (Krause and Backonja, 2003) for the assessment\nof neuropathic pain, has advanced pain research. At\nthe same time detailed questionnaires require investiga-\ntors to deal with significant increases in the amount of\nself-report data. To facilitate this task, summary scores\nhelp differentiate neuropathic pain (NP) from non-neu-\nropathic pain (nonNP).\n\nCalculating a score seems to be rather archaic in the\nlight of more advanced computer-based approaches\nsuch as artificial neural networks (ANN). ANN are\nassumed to offer an advantage in dealing with nonlinear\nrelationships that may exist among pain descriptors, i.e.,\nrelationships that do not obey a relation like \u2018\u2018the higher\ndescriptor A the higher descriptor B\u2019\u2019. For instance, the\nmajority of biological phenomena are nonlinear, e.g.,\nmost relations between hormones and their effects are\nconsidered nonlinear, as are all events that are subject\nto threshold, such as neuronal spiking (Fallahati et al.,\n2001, 2002). Thus, the objective of the present study is\nto evaluate if ANN can improve upon current scoring\nsystems. Since the ANN training set and the established\nscoring systems are based upon different patient data,\nlogistic regression (LR) is used on the same data as\nthe ANN. By employing LR, a conventional statistical\nmethod, we are able to establish to what extent nonlin-\nearities are important in the data.\n\nArtificial Neural Networks have emerged as a power-\nful tool for solving statistical regression and pattern\nclassification problems in a multitude of domains: for\ncomprehensive state-of-the-art expository surveys\n(Arbib, 2002), for comprehensive treatment (Pr\u0131\u0301ncipe\net al., 2000), and for biological pain networks (Devor,\n2002). The main concept of the ANN is step-wise\nimprovement of the estimates for model parameters,\nso that the pattern classification errors are minimized.\nThe heuristics behind most variants of ANN are loosely\nbased on networks of biological neurons in which\nHebb\u2019s plasticity mechanism is regarded as the basis\nfor learning. The model parameters are reminiscent of\nthe strength of synaptic messages passing among neu-\nrons. Step-wise adjusting of the parameters is called\ntraining the network, and often is implemented via a\npopular architecture called a multi-layer perceptron\n(MLP). To train an MLP, an efficient algorithm called\nBack Propagation (Rumelhart et al., 1986; Pr\u0131\u0301ncipe\net al., 2000) has been adapted and refined in dozens of\nways. Numerous properties of neural network models,\nsuch as adaptation and robustness (Haykin, 1999; Pr\u0131\u0301n-\ncipe et al., 2000; Devor, 2002), complement traditional\nstatistical methods, and in some cases such as non-para-\nmetric regression, ANN is the preferred methods of data\nanalysis.\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Patients and the diagnostic procedure\n\nPatients from two academic pain clinics were\nrecruited for this study: University of Wisconsin Hospi-\ntal and Clinics in Madison, Wisconsin and Oregon\nHealth and Science University (OHSU) in Portland,\nOregon. The respective institutional review boards at\neach institution approved the study, which was con-\nducted from 2000 to 2002.\n\nAll new patients presenting to the respective pain\nclinics with chronic pain of six months or longer dura-\ntion were approached to participate in the study and\nthose who signed consent forms were given a set of ques-\ntionnaires. The questionnaires included an early version\nof the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) and the\nNeuropathic Pain Scale (NPS). The early version of\nNPQ was utilized because it was the only version avail-\nable at the time. The later version of NPQ was the result\nof additional analysis and revisions that were performed\nat a later date (Krause and Backonja, 2003). Patients,\nwho had more than one component of pain, such as\nradicular pain in the leg as well as mechanical low back\npain, were asked to concentrate on and rate the most\nsevere component of their pain. This procedure is in\naccord with the procedures suggested by the literature\n(Backonja and Stacey, 2004; Bennett, 2001; Rasmussen\net al., 2004).\n\nPatients were evaluated by pain fellowship-trained\npain clinicians with pain medicine certification. Medical\nand pain diagnoses as well as classification of patients\u2019\nprimary pain into neuropathic or non-neuropathic were\nmade on the basis of comprehensive medical and pain\nhistory, physical examination and laboratory tests. The\nclinical pain diagnosis for each patient served as the\naccepted correct diagnosis for this study. The results\nof the neuropathic pain-specific questionnaires (NPS\nand NPQ) were not known to the examiners at the time\nof visit and were not used as the basis of diagnosis.\n\nThe primary criterion for the diagnosis of neuro-\npathic pain was the presence of pain accompanied by\nsensory and motor abnormalities or only sensory abnor-\nmalities, in patients with an appropriate history consis-\ntent with a neurological injury or disorder. In the case\nof diagnostic uncertainty, laboratory and imaging stud-\nies were utilized to confirm the diagnosis. For patients\nwho experienced pain that was thought to be due to\nco-existing neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain\nmechanisms, such as radicular low back pain, classifica-\ntion was made on the basis of the most predominant\ncomponent of pain.\n\n\n\nNPS Sharp\n\nIn\npu\n\nt l\nay\n\ner\n\nO\nut\n\npu\nt l\nay\n\ner\n\nH\nid\n\nde\nn \n\nla\nye\n\nr\n\nnonNP\n\nNPQ Burning\n\nNPQ Cold\n\nFlow of information\n\n1\n\n2\n\nn\n\nWeighted connections\n\nNP\n\nFig. 1. Structure of ANN used for the differentiation of NP and\nnonNP patients: as an input pain descriptors are entered that result\nfrom the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) and the Neuropathic\nPain Scale (NPS), respectively. This information is forwarded to a\nmaximum of n hidden neurons. The intermediate results of the hidden\nneurons are forwarded to output neurons representing neuropathic\npain (NP) and non-neuropathic pain (nonNP).\n\n372 M. Behrman et al. / European Journal of Pain 11 (2007) 370\u2013376\nPatients were excluded if they had a condition that\ncould not be diagnosed or receive a mechanistic classifi-\ncation (neuropathic vs. non-neuropathic), if they could\nnot specifically rate their pain, if they had diffuse total-\nbody pain, or if incomplete medical records compro-\nmised our ability to diagnose the patient\u2019s condition.\n\n2.2. Scoring systems\n\nThe Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ), includ-\ning early version used in this study, was developed pre-\nviously using factor analysis and discriminant analysis\non 382 patients with purely neuropathic and non-neuro-\npathic pain (Krause and Backonja, 2003). We employed\nthis scoring system on the present data to compare scor-\ning results with the LR and ANN results. Additionally,\nwe created an ad hoc scoring system for the Neuropathic\nPain Scale (NPS) as described by Argoff et al. (2004).\nAccording to Argoff et al., the NPS mean composite\nscores from all 10 items were used to evaluate pain\nreduction. We used the standard deviations they\nreported as a cutoff point to create neuropathic (greater\nthan 42) and non-neuropathic (42 or less) groups.\n\n2.3. Univariate analysis\n\nOrdinal variables, e.g., those from the NPQ and NPS,\nwere treated as linear variables. A linear fit is regarded\nas the natural approach when expecting a monotone\neffect of the ordinal covariate (Agresti, 1990). Thus, only\nevaluating continuous variables, the two-tailed Wilco-\nxon test for two independent samples (Mann\u2013Whitney\nU test) was employed to reveal variables that possibly\nenable a helpful differentiation between NP and nonNP.\n\n2.4. Multivariate analysis\n\nThe multivariate analysis was performed by a logistic\nregression (LR) model, the classical approach for a bin-\nary outcome, as well as by an artificial neural network\n(ANN), a method that is assumed to detect not only lin-\near but also nonlinear relationships between the predict-\ning variables and the dependent variable (NP, nonNP)\nas well as relationships between the predicting variables.\nComparable results of both methods would indicate that\nnonlinear relationships are of no importance for the\npresent classification problem. Otherwise \u2013 in case the\nANN should outperform the LR approach \u2013 nonlinear-\nities must be considered.\n\n2.5. Artificial neural networks\n\nANNs are computer-based techniques which have\nbeen frequently applied for classifying clinical data\nand patients (Dybowski, 2001; Malmgren et al., 2000).\nANNs use nonlinear mathematical equations to succes-\nsively develop meaningful relationships between input\nand output variables through a learning process. They\nhave a \u2018\u2018learning\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018training phase\u2019\u2019 and a \u2018\u2018recall\nphase\u2019\u2019. In the learning phase, the relationships between\nthe different input and output variables are established\nby adaptations of the weight factors assigned to the con-\nnections between the layers of artificial neurons. This\nadaptation is based on rules that are set in the learning\nalgorithm. At the end of the learning process, the weight\nfactors are fixed. In the recall phase, data from cases not\npreviously interpreted by the network are entered, and\nan output is calculated based on the above-mentioned,\nand now fixed, weight factors. Diagrammatic represen-\ntation of a standard feedforward network is given in\nFig. 1. Data are entered at the input neurons and further\nprocessed in the hidden layer and output layer.\n\nFeatures were fed into a feedforward network imple-\nmented in a prototype called ACMD, standing for\n\u2018\u2018Approximation and Classification of Medical Data\u2019\u2019\n(Microsoft Visual C++, Office Software International,\nUSA) (Linder and Po\u0308ppl, 2001), which is in principle\nbased on a multilayer perceptron (Rumelhart et al.,\n1986), using adaptive propagation (Linder et al., 2000)\nfor automatic learning. Each of five networks were\narranged as an ensemble, which makes them more\nrobust than single networks and more suitable for learn-\ning with only a small amount of data (Bishop, 1995). To\nmake the learning less susceptible to so-called overfitting\n(Geman et al., 1992), a strategy known as \u2018\u2018Early Stop-\nping\u2019\u2019 was used (Prechelt, 1998). ACMD comprises a\nnumber of further strategies both improving the general-\nization performance and accelerating the convergence\nspeed. Several benchmarks give evidence that ACMD\nprovides an excellent tool for learning feedforward net-\nworks. For details please see \u2018\u2018ACMD: A practical tool\nfor automatic neural net based learning\u2019\u2019 (Linder and\nPo\u0308ppl, 2001).

Logistic regression\n\nBinary logistic regression inclusive feature selection\nwas calculated by the software SPSS V.11.5.1 (SPSS\nInc., Chicago, USA). Exclusively default settings were\nchosen. In a resulting model, the predicted value bP \u00f0y\u00de\nof a patient was calculated by\n\nbP \u00f0y\u00de \u00bc\n1\n\n1\u00fe e\ufffd\u00f0b0\u00feb1\ufffdx1\u00feb2\ufffdx2\u00fe\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u00febp \ufffdxp\u00de\n\nwhere bi denotes the parameters estimate for the ith var-\niable. As illustrated by the above equation, the LR ap-\nproach assumes no interdependencies between the\npredicting variables and only linear relationships.\n\n2.7. Validation\n\nFor both methods, validation was done by 5-fold\ncross-validation using 4/5 of all cases for specifying each\nclassification method and testing with the remaining\ncases. By performing five rounds of allocation, every\ncase is used once for the purpose of validation.\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Demographics\n\nThe patients\u2019 mean age was 46.4 years with a range\n21\u201379 years. A total of 304 patients entered the study.\nOf the 165 who were enrolled complete data was avail-\nable for 155 and they were classified as either predomi-\nnantly neuropathic pain (n = 91) or non-neuropathic\n(n = 64). For 114 patients for whom duration of pain\nwas established on the basis of a specific date of pain\nonset, there was an average duration of 78.9 (+64.2)\nmonths for patients with neuropathic and 131.6\n(+113.4) months for patients with non-neuropathic pain.\n\nOur clinics see many patients with neuropathic pain\nand the subjects\u2019 diagnoses reflected our patient popula-\ntions: post-traumatic neuralgias including complex\nregional pain syndrome type I and II, radiculopathies,\na wide variety of peripheral neuropathies, post-herpetic\nneuralgia, trigeminal neuropathy, and many etiologies\nof central pain syndrome. Non-neuropathic pain\nincluded many different diagnoses and etiologies such\nas arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions,\nabdominal and other visceral pain, and headaches.\n\n3.2. Scoring systems\n\nThe NPQ scoring system performed similarly to the\nLR and ANN overall. However, it performed better\nwith nonNP cases than with NP cases (Table 1). The\nNPS scoring system did not perform well. Since classify-\ning by chance achieves an accuracy of 58.7% (91/155),\ni.e., assigning all patients who suffer from NP, NPS per-\nformed worse than chance.\n\n3.3. Univariate analysis\n\nEvaluating the predictive power of each variable, the\nMann\u2013Whitney U test revealed a statistically significant\ndifference regarding NP and nonNP in 12 of the 32 vari-\nables. Box-and-Whisker plots of the 12 variables in\nquestion are shown in Fig. 2 demonstrating a wide over-\nlap between the boxes for NP and nonNP, respectively.\nAs a consequence, none of the variables alone enables a\nsufficient distinction of the type of pain.\n\n3.4. Multivariate analysis\n\nApplying the ANN, NP and nonNP was correctly\npredicted in 69.0% of all cases (NP, 75.8%; nonNP,\n59.4%). Applying the LR, NP and nonNP was correctly\npredicted in 67.7% of all cases (NP, 73.6%; nonNP,\n59.4%). Thus, both methods achieved a statistically sig-\nnificant result (v2 test: p-value < 0.001). The difference\nbetween the accuracies of ANN and LR is only 1.3%.\nA two-tailed McNemar test showed that there is no sig-\nnificance between the ANN and LR results (p-\nvalue = 0.832) (Table 2).\n\nEvaluating subsets of the patients comprising at least\n13 cases, the predictive power greatly varies between the\ndiagnostic sub-entities (Fig. 3). The degree of certainty\nwith which the ANN is able to classify the diagnostic\nsub-entities is consistent with clinical experience.\n4. Discussion\n\nThis study of non-selected chronic pain patients dem-\nonstrated that advanced methods of analysis, ANN and\nLR, performed slightly better in classifying patients with\nneuropathic pain than they did of those with non-neuro-\npathic pain, when compared to the standard scoring of\nthe NPQ. Characterizing a patient\u2019s pain symptoms\nand descriptors is always the starting point in the diag-\nnosis and assessment of pain. Our results are consistent\nwith the notion that neuropathic pain symptoms could\nprovide a reasonable level of certainty in the diagnostic\n\n\n\n9164 9164 9164 9164 9164 9164 9164N =\n\nNPnonNP\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\nNPQ Burning\n\nNPQ Numbness\n\nNPQ Tingling\n\nNPQ Cold\n\nNPS Sharp\n\nNPS Hot\n\nNPS Sensitive\n\n12410294\n\n138\n10899\n\n117\n\n134115114102\n127\n125\n\n139\n\n141\n\n124\n117\n\nFig. 2.

Accuracy obtained by the NPQ scoring sys-\ntem (68.4%) is very similar to the 69.0% achieved by the\nANN. Since the NPQ scoring system was based on 382\npatients and therefore on a larger database than the\nANN (155 patients), one may speculate that the ANN\ncould have been somewhat more accurate using the\nsame large database for training. This assumption is\nsupported by the results of the LR approach based on\n155 patients that is worse than the NPQ. However, a\ndirect comparison of ANN and LR does not show a sig-\nnificant advantage of the ANN technique. This indicates\nthat nonlinear relationships between pain descriptors do\nnot play a significant role in classifying NP and nonNP\npatients for this dataset. NPS was not designed to be a\ndiscriminative tool and consequently it is not surprising\nthat NPS did not perform well in classifying NP and\nnonNP patients.\n\nThe degree of certainty with which the ANN is able to\nclassify the diagnostic sub-entities is consistent with clin-\nical experience. For example, with neuropathic pain due\nto polyneuropathy (NP polyneurop) or causalgia (NP\ncausalgia), where primary pathologic and pain mecha-\nnisms are due to direct neurological involvement, classi-\nfication is more likely to be correct even if only on the\nbasis of symptoms severity. In contrast, neuropathic pain\ndue to radiculopathy (NP-radic) which is frequently\nassociated with low back pain, is less likely to be classi-\nfied correctly on the basis of the symptoms severity rat-\ning alone, in spite of patients\u2019 best efforts to rate only\nthat particular pain. The presence of non-neuropathic\npain certainly increases the challenge of accurately clas-\nsifying the neuropathic pain based solely on symptoms.\n\nThe main methodological finding of our study is that\nnonlinearities within the data obtained at one time point\nare not significant since the ANN and LR results are\nroughly equivalent. This finding is reinforced by the\nrough equivalence of the ANN and LR results with\nthe NPQ scoring system. Future work will evaluate if\nthis is also true for data recorded over a period of time.\nAlso, the diagnostic sub-entity classification results\n(Fig. 3) show that patients who exhibit mixed NP and\nnonNP traits are difficult to classify with data from\nNPQ and NPS. In comparison, cases with diagnoses\nwhich are \u2018\u2018classical\u2019\u2019 are relatively easily classified. This\nlikely indicates that more data for the difficult-to-classify\ncases are needed, as well as new methods for identifying\nwhether a given patient is in a difficult-to-classify cate-\ngory need to be employed. We have also shown that\nmodern methods, such as the ACMD ANN package,\nhandle pain classification problems as well as or better\nthan methods established in pain research, such as LR\nand the NPQ scoring system.\n\nNeuropathic pain is a new and still evolving area of\npain research and classification of patients based on\nclinical presentation and according to diagnostic criteria\nis undergoing debate (Backonja, 2003). Consequently, at\ntimes questions are raised regarding the classification of\npain disorders such as CRPS type I. In this study, CRPS\ntype I was included into neuropathic pain group on the\nbasis of sensory abnormalities of not only positive but\nalso negative sensory signs, such as loss of sensation to\none or more sensory stimulation modalities, as well as\nmotor findings of weakness and movement disorders,\nsuch as tremor (Stanton-Hicks, 2003).\n\nThe clinical diagnostic process is complex and draws\nfrom multiple levels of clinical evaluation. For routine\nclinical use a diagnostic accuracy of 68% (LR) or 69%\n(ANN) may not be acceptable. However, this degree\nof accuracy derived from pain descriptors and pain\nqualities alone is statistically significant and points to\nan important area for further exploration. It is our belief\nthat continuing to employ methods such as ANN, which\nare able to take advantage of nonlinearities within data,\nis important to further research, especially as more com-\nplete patient profiles are collected. Traditionally there\nhas been a hesitation if not a strong resistance to obtain-\ning large amounts of data over periods of time because\nof concerns about methods of analysis. We are confident\nthat the methods presented here are appropriately suited\nfor that type of data.\nReferences\n\nArgoff C, Galer B, Jensen M, Oleka N, Gammaitoni A.
