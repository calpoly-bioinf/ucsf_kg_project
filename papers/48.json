Balaban,* Donald H. McBurney,\u2020 and Mark A. Affeltranger\u2020\n\nAbstract: Humans vary in oral pain tolerance. Our earlier studies noted that the responses of\nsubjects show 1 of 3 qualitative response patterns to a single oral capsaicin concentration, which we\n\ntermed a tonic pattern (level detection response), a phasic pattern (change detection response), and\n\nan integrator pattern (cumulative irritation) response. These patterns were modeled quantitatively as\n\nthe sum of 3 underlying processes. Two time-varying capsaicin stimulus profiles were designed from\n\nthe quantitative model. In the ascending step paradigm, 30 ppm capsaicin was presented to 42\n\nsubjects for 15 minutes, followed immediately and without explanation by 300 ppm capsaicin for 25\n\nminutes. In the descending step paradigm, 300 ppm capsaicin was presented to 36 other subjects for\n\n24 minutes, followed by 10 ppm for 22 minutes. Subjective burn was rated at 1 minute and then at\n\n3-minute intervals throughout the presentation. Fuzzy cluster analysis identified 3 distinct response\n\nphenotypes in each paradigm, corresponding to level detection, change detection, and cumulative\n\nirritation response patterns identified previously. Discriminant functions permitted classification of\n\nthese phenotypes from the response patterns. Thus, these paradigms provide the first quantitative\n\nphenotypic description of distinct oral pain responses to a common irritant, capsaicin.\n\nPerspective: This study examined the time-dependent behavior of pain produced by oral application\nof capsaicin. Three distinct temporal response phenotypes were identified objectively: level detection,\n\nchange detection, and cumulative irritation detection. These time-dependent analyses provide a new\n\ndimension to understanding individual differences in pain sensation in clinical settings.\n\n\u00a9 2005 by the American Pain Society\n\nKey words: Capsaicin, pain intensity, oral, phenotypes, mathematical modeling.\n\nI\nt is well recognized that marked individual differences\n\nin pain sensation and pain tolerance reflect influences\n\nof biologic, social, and cultural determinants.15 It is\n\nunclear whether these differences reflect random varia-\n\ntions about a mean behavior or distinct response pheno-\n\ntypes for painful stimulation. In previous studies13,14 we\n\nnoted 3 systematic patterns of human psychophysical re-\n\nsponses to a constant oral capsaicin stimulus, which we\n\ntermed a tonic pattern (level detection response), a pha-\n\nsic pattern (change detection response), or a rising pat-\n\ntern (cumulative irritation response). We were able to\n\ndescribe these patterns by a mechanistic model13 that\n\nrepresents individual responses to capsaicin as a sum of 3\n\nparallel processes (Fig 1). Each process corresponds to 1\n\nof the 3 temporal patterns just described. The stimulus-\n\nresponse relationship for each process appears to follow\n\na distinct power function.14\n\nThis model is also able to predict temporal interactions\ntermed sensitization, desensitization, and cross adap-\ntation.1,2 The model is also useful for designing\ntime-varying stimuli to test whether our previous obser-\nvations reflect different phenotypic categories of sub-\njects\u2019 oral pain responses.\n\nThe model assumes that the response to 2 simulta-\nneous stimuli is the sum of the responses to the individ-\nual stimuli. On the basis of individual differences in re-\nsponses to single capsaicin doses,13,14 we predicted that\nsuccessive exposure to 2 concentrations of capsaicin\nwould also distinguish 3 response phenotypes. The dura-\ntions and capsaicin concentrations for stimuli were based\non these modeled responses.\n\nHere we use fuzzy cluster analysis and discriminant\nanalysis to identify 3 distinct psychophysical response\nphenotypes in 2 new stimulus paradigms: a double step\nincrease in stimulus intensity and a step decrease from a\nhigh to a low intensity. These results yield a new method\nof classifying human pain responses by temporal pat-\ntern, rather than threshold or magnitude of response.\n\nMethods\n\nSubjects\nSeventy-eight undergraduate students participated in\n\nthe experiment for course credit.

The research protocol was\nreviewed and approved by the University of Pittsburgh\nInstitutional Review Board, and informed consent was\nobtained from each subject.\n\nCapsaicin Stimuli\nCapsaicin (Sigma, St Louis, Mo; 98%) was dissolved in\n\n95% ethyl alcohol to 6000 ppm. This stock solution was\ndiluted in water to the final concentration. All solutions\nwere stored at \ufffd10\u00b0C. Twenty-five microliters of the so-\nlution was pipetted onto 1.27-cm diameter filter paper\ndisks (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) and allowed to\ndry. The filter papers were wetted with 50 \ufffdL of water\njust before being placed on the tongue. Subjects rated\nthe burning sensation elicited by a capsaicin stimulus in a\nsingle session. For the step-up experiment, 30 ppm cap-\nsaicin was applied to the tongue for 15 minutes, fol-\nlowed immediately and without explanation by 300 ppm\ncapsaicin for 25 minutes. For the step-down experiment,\n300 ppm capsaicin was applied to the tongue for 24 min-\nutes, followed by 10 ppm for 22 minutes.\n\nProtocol\nStandard, nonmodulus, magnitude estimation instruc-\n\ntions were read to the subjects, and any questions were\nanswered. Because it assesses a temporal profile, free\nmagnitude estimation is appropriate to display proper-\nties such as an evolving integrator response. Subjects\nwere given practice judging the distance between the\nexperimenter\u2019s hands. They wrote their responses to the\ncapsaicin on index cards, which they turned over after\neach trial. Filter papers were laid out in a matrix array\nbefore the experiment to prevent the subject from sur-\nmising that all stimuli were the same. There was an ex-\n\ncess of both filter papers and index cards to prevent the\nsubject from anticipating the end of the session.\n\nThe stimuli were placed on the end of the outstretched\ntongue by means of forceps and left for 1 minute. The\nsubjects gently held the filter paper in place with a\ntongue depressor. They were asked to keep the tongue\nextended between the closed lips for the duration of the\nsession, but they were permitted to retract the tongue\nand close the mouth briefly as needed when the filter\npapers were changed every minute.\n\nAt the end of the first 1-minute interval of stimulation\nand every third minute thereafter, subjects were asked\nto rate the burning sensation they felt at that moment. A\ncomputer beeped to signal the replacement of the filter\npaper and the rating of the stimuli.\n\nData Transformation\nData were transformed by multiplying each response\n\nby a constant so that each subject\u2019s mean response be-\ncame 100. This was done so that each subject would\nmake an equal contribution to the average data. Note\nthat this transformation obscures differences between\nsubjects in overall response to capsaicin. Fuzzy C-means\ncluster analysis was performed in MATLAB (MathWorks,\nNatick, Mass) by using the \u201cfcm.m\u201d algorithm in the\n\u201cFuzzy toolkit.\u201d Fuzzy C-means cluster analysis is a\nmethod for partitioning a data set into a specified num-\nber of clusters, on the basis of an iterative minimization\nof the within groups sum of square error for the selected\npartition.4 In contrast to classic cluster analysis, which\nforces each observation into a single cluster, fuzzy cluster\nanalysis generates a membership function matrix (values\nranging from 0 to 1) that specifies the grade of member-\nship of each observation in each cluster and an objective\nfunction specifying the location of the center of each\n\nFigure 1. The transfer function for the model for psychophysical responses to capsaicin is shown in block diagram form. The\nresponses are modeled as a sum of 3 parallel processes: a tonic process with gain a, a phasic process with gain b, and an integrator\nprocess with gain c. The Laplace representations of each transfer function are shown in the boxes associated with each process.\n\n316 Categories of Oral Capsaicin Pain Time Course\n\n\n\ncluster. Because the sum of the membership matrix en-\ntries for each observation is 1, the membership matrix\nentries are analogous to the likelihood of membership\nin each cluster. The theory and applications of these\nmethods are described in detail in the statistics litera-\nture. Discriminant analysis was performed with SYSTAT\n10.2 (www.systat.com) software.\n\nModel Implementation and Parameter\nEstimation\n\nThe model has 3 free parameters: tonic gain, phasic\ngain, and integrator process gain. The 3 time constants\nand relative response magnitudes to the 2 concentra-\ntions of capsaicin were fixed on the basis of previous\nstudies.2,13,14 The input to the model is first transformed\nto reflect the exponential relationship between stimulus\nconcentration and normalized burn sensation for each\nprocess.14 For the ascending step stimuli (30 to 300 ppm),\nthe tonic input was simulated as a constant step of 48.7,\nfollowed by a step to 91.3. The phasic input (which satu-\nrates at 100 ppm) was simulated as an initial step of 43.6,\nfollowed by a step to 98.8, whereas the input to the\nintegrator was set as a step to 15.8, followed by a step to\n63.6. For the descending step stimuli (300 to 10 ppm), the\ntonic input was simulated as a constant step of 91.3,\nfollowed by a step down to 36.1. The phasic input (which\nsaturates at 100 ppm) was simulated as an initial step of\n98.8, followed by a step to 19.8, whereas the input to the\n\nintegrator was set as a step to 63.6, followed by subtrac-\ntion of a response to a step of size 55.5 (the difference\nbetween the 63.6 magnitude for a 300-ppm stimulus and\nthe 8.1 magnitude for a 10-ppm stimulus). The transfer\nfunctions of the individual processes (including the time\nconstants) are identical to the model in our previous pub-\nlications.2,13,14 As in our previous studies, the model was\nsimulated in MATLAB for least squares estimation of the\ngain of each process by using \u201cleastsq.m\u201d algorithm.\n\nResults\n\nThe group median response to the ascending step\nshowed 2 distinct limbs (Fig 2). During application of the\ninitial 30-ppm stimulus, the response rose with a roughly\nexponential time course to approximately 60 arbitrary\nunits. Application of the 300-ppm stimulus produced a\nsecond, roughly exponential rise to approximately 150\narbitrary units at the conclusion of the trial. The median\nresponse to the descending step stimulus profile (Fig 2)\nrose to a plateau at 150 arbitrary units during application\nof the initial 300-ppm stimulus, followed by a roughly\nexponential fall to 0 during application of the 10-ppm\nstimulus.\n\nThe behavior of the integrator response has not been\ntested for a large decrease in capsaicin concentration.\nOne possibility is that the response continues to inte-\ngrate, but at a rate dictated by the reduced stimulus. A\nsecond possibility, however, is that the integrator re-\n\nFigure 2.

The model was first fitted to the\ndata from the descending step experiment to choose\nbetween 2 versions of the integrator process. The first\nversion assumed that the integrator component would\ncontinue to increase when the stimulus was decreased\nbecause of continued integration of the lower intensity.\nThe second version assumed that the integrator would\ndischarge at the drop in concentration with the same\nrate with which it had charged. The active integrator\ndischarge was implemented by adding an integrator re-\nsponse to a negative step of the same magnitude as the\nconcentration drop. The discharging version yielded a\nbetter fit, particularly of the second (lower) concentra-\ntion portion of the data. Next, the model was fit simul-\ntaneously to the median data from both experiments,\nyielding a single set of parameters that maximized the fit\nto the 2 sets of data. The group median responses for the\n2 experiments were fitted well by a weighted sum of\ntonic (gain \ufffd 0.55), phasic (gain \ufffd 1.70), and integrator\n(gain \ufffd 0.66) components (Fig 2).\n\nConsistent with our previous observations, objective\nstatistical methods identified 3 different temporal re-\nsponse profiles that characterize groups of subjects.\nFuzzy C-means cluster analysis4 was performed on square\nroot transformed responses of individual subjects to\nidentify heterogeneous underlying response patterns.\n\nThese analyses were done separately for the 2 experi-\n\nments. Subjects were characterized as belonging to a\n\nsingle cluster (group response pattern) if their member-\n\nship set value was greater than 0.45 for that cluster and\n\nless than 0.4 for any other cluster. Subjects with approx-\n\nimately equal membership values for 2 clusters were not\n\nused for characterizing the properties of any cluster.\n\nThree distinct response patterns were identified for\n\nthe ascending capsaicin steps. Thirteen of the 42 subjects\n\nfell into Cluster 1, which might be described as a tonic\n\nresponse profile (Fig 3). The responses of these subjects\n\nshowed a simple exponential rise to an initial plateau in\n\nthe range of 50 to 100 arbitrary units during application\n\nof the initial 30-ppm stimulus, followed by a similar rise\n\nto a plateau of 120 to 200 arbitrary units. By contrast, the\n\n12 subjects in Cluster 2 showed a more phasic response\n\npattern (Fig 4) that rose within 5 minutes to a median\n\nplateau of approximately 60 arbitrary units, followed by\n\na jump to a slowly increasing response pattern after ap-\n\nplication of the second capsaicin concentration. Finally,\n\nthe 9 subjects in Cluster 3 showed a \u201crising pattern\u201d\n\nobserved in our previous studies.13,14 These responses\n\nshowed a simple exponential rise to the first stimulus,\n\nfollowed by a rising response during application of the\n\nhigher stimulus concentration (Fig 5). The remaining 8\n\nsubjects showed patterns that were almost equally likely\n\nFigure 3. Level detection response cluster. The upper panel shows the median burn sensation that characterizes the pattern termed\nCluster 1 (13 subjects) from the group of subjects given ascending capsaicin stimulus concentrations. The lower panel shows the\nmedian burn sensation from the corresponding cluster of subjects (n \ufffd 13) from the group exposed to descending capsaicin stimulus\nconcentrations. The curves on each panel show the fit of a model with a single set of parameters to the responses. The least squares\nestimates of the 3 gains in the model are listed in the figure.\n\n318 Categories of Oral Capsaicin Pain Time Course\n\n\n\nto be (1) in cluster 1 or cluster 2 (5 subjects) or (2) in\ncluster 1 or cluster 3 (3 subjects).\n\nThe responses to the descending capsaicin steps also\nshowed 3 distinct patterns. The median response for the\n13 subjects in Cluster 1 (Fig 3) was virtually identical to\nthe median response for all subjects (Fig 2). The response\nrose rapidly to a plateau during application of 300 ppm\ncapsaicin. When the stimulus concentration dropped to\n10 ppm, the response declined within about 12 minutes\nto a plateau between 0 and 50 arbitrary units. The 7\nsubjects in Cluster 2 (Fig 4) showed a response that rose\nrapidly to a peak, followed by a flat to declining response\nduring the 300-ppm stimulation. When the stimulus con-\ncentration dropped to 10 ppm, the response declined\nprecipitously, reaching 0 by the end of the session in all\nsubjects. The 8 subjects in Cluster 3 (Fig 5) showed a slow\nrise during the 25-minute exposure to 300 ppm capsaicin,\nfollowed by a slow decline during exposure to 10 ppm\ncapsaicin. Among the 8 individuals with intermediate re-\nsponse patterns to descending steps, 7 showed a pattern\nintermediate between clusters 1 and 2, and 1 subject\nshowed a pattern intermediate between clusters 2 and 3.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that the clusters from both ex-\nperiments constitute the same 3 subject types with dis-\ntinct response characteristics, a least squares regression\nfit was performed to obtain a single set of parameters for\na model fit to the response to both the ascending con-\n\ncentration subjects and descending concentration sub-\njects. Responses of Cluster 1 subjects from both experi-\nments (Fig 3) were described by a single model with a\ntonic gain of 0.68, a phasic gain of 1.65, and an integra-\ntor gain of 0.61, which behaves as a level detector. Re-\nsponses of Cluster 2 subjects from both experiments (Fig\n4) were described by a single model with a phasic gain of\n3.72 and an integrator gain of 0.28, which behaves in a\nmanner that is highly sensitive to changes in concentra-\ntion. Responses of Cluster 3 subjects from both experi-\nments (Fig 5) were attributed to a sum of a small tonic\ngain (0.15), a moderate phasic gain (0.65), and a large\nintegrator gain (1.90), which reflects high sensitivity to\ncumulative irritation. Thus, these findings support our\nearlier suggestion that there are 3 phenotypic patterns\nfor subjective burning sensations elicited by oral irrita-\ntion by capsaicin. It is noteworthy that this classification\napproach ignores individual differences in perceived in-\ntensity. This contrasts sharply with all previous studies,\nbecause they are based on sensitivity and intensity, not\nthe time course.\n\nWithin each 2-step stimulus paradigm, the subject\u2019s re-\nsponse phenotype could be identified by a discriminant\nanalysis of the responses across time points. This ap-\nproach yielded 2 canonical variables for classifying sub-\nject responses from each experimental paradigm (Tables\n1 and 2). These factor scores yielded 100% correct classi-\n\nFigure 4.

Among subjects who\ncould not be classified unambiguously by the C-means\nanalysis, 4 of 8 ascending step responses were classified\nas a response phenotype by the discriminant function,\nwhereas only 1 of 8 was classified for the descending\n\nresponses; these discriminant classifications were consis-\ntent with the membership set values from fuzzy C-means\nanalysis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur findings show that time-dependent behavior adds\na new dimension to classification of oral sensitivity to\nchemical stimuli. All previous classification schemata for\nindividual difference in response to chemical stimuli\n(whether tastants or irritants) have been based on in-\nstantaneous measures of magnitude or threshold. Be-\ncause pain responses, like all biologic processes, take\nplace over time, instantaneous measures of magnitude\nface the problem of choice of the appropriate moment.\nOur approach, by contrast, permits an objective classifi-\ncation based on the temporal response profile of each\nsubject to a single experimental exposure, independent\nof the absolute magnitude or choice of a single moment.\n\nThe labeled magnitude scale is a visual analog scale\nanchored by verbal descriptors and having ratio-level\nproperties.9 Bartoshuk3 has modified the upper limit to\nread, \u201cstrongest imaginable sensation of any kind,\u201d to\npermit a more valid comparison between subjects. We\nbelieve this generalized labeled magnitude scale is still\nsubject to ceiling effects, especially in studies that do not\npresent examples of extremely strong stimuli at the be-\nginning of the session.

Of course, the normaliza-\n\ntion of data used in the present study thereby ignores\n\nindividual differences in magnitude of pain.\n\nIn our previous studies, the time course of the subjec-\n\ntive burning sensation to oral capsaicin was modeled\n\nexplicitly as a linear sum of 3 underlying processes: a\n\ntonic mechanism, a phasic mechanism, and an integrator\n\ncomponent. This study provided one refinement of the\n\nmodel structure for a previously unexplored experimen-\n\ntal condition, a precipitous decrease in capsaicin concen-\n\ntration. Under these conditions, the integrator process\n\nappears to discharge. When the discharging of the inte-\n\ngrating component is incorporated, the results of this\n\nstudy support the adequacy of this linear modeling ap-\n\nproach because the 3 phenotypic responses could be\n\nmodeled effectively as distinct linear sums of the 3 com-\n\nponent processes. It is also noteworthy that the model\n\nused in this study was highly constrained and had only 3\n\nfree parameters. Specifically, the time constants of these\n\nprocesses and the psychophysical scaling factors of each\n\nprocess for capsaicin concentration were fixed by esti-\n\nmates from our earlier studies. Because our initial study\n\nfound that the tonic component and the integrator com-\n\nponent show long-term adaptation to capsaicin expo-\n\nsure, the response phenotypes likely represent an inter-\n\naction between genetics and history of exposure. Our\n\nprevious data14 indicate that response phenotypes are\n\nstable for separate applications of different concentra-\n\ntions of capsaicin, separated by at least a 1-week interval.\n\nFast et al8 and Prutkin et al16 have extensively docu-\n\nmented the importance of 6-N-propylthiouracil (PROP)\n\nand/or phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) sensitivity as a predic-\n\ntor of individual differences in taste and oral irritant sen-\n\nsitivity. The inability to taste PROP or PTC was originally\n\nbelieved to be a simple mendelian recessive trait,5,19\n\nwith homozygous PROP tasters displaying highest sensi-\n\ntivity.11,17 Genetic linkage studies7,10,12,17,18 have pre-\n\nsented evidence for loci on chromosomes 7q, 16p, and\n\n5p. Positional cloning studies by Drayna et al6,7 and Kim\n\net al12 have identified 3 distinct polymorphisms within\n\nthe PTC gene on chromosome 7q, which affect amino\n\nacids 49, 262, and 296 of the TAS2R receptor protein.\n\nThey also demonstrated that distinct haplotypes are as-\n\nsociated with different sensitivities to PTC and PROP, so\n\nthat expression of the PAV haplotype is associated with\n\nhigh PROP sensitivity.

Our earlier studies noted that the responses ofsubjects show 1 of 3 qualitative response patterns to a single oral capsaicin concentration, which wetermed a tonic pattern (level detection response), a phasic pattern (change detection response), andan integrator pattern (cumulative irritation) response. These patterns were modeled quantitatively asthe sum of 3 underlying processes. Two time-varying capsaicin stimulus pro\ufb01les were designed fromthe quantitative model. In the ascending step paradigm, 30 ppm capsaicin was presented to 42subjects for 15 minutes, followed immediately and without explanation by 300 ppm capsaicin for 25minutes. In the descending step paradigm, 300 ppm capsaicin was presented to 36 other subjects for24 minutes, followed by 10 ppm for 22 minutes. Subjective burn was rated at 1 minute and then at3-minute intervals throughout the presentation. Fuzzy cluster analysis identi\ufb01ed 3 distinct responsephenotypes in each paradigm, corresponding to level detection, change detection, and cumulativeirritation response patterns identi\ufb01ed previously. Discriminant functions permitted classi\ufb01cation ofthese phenotypes from the response patterns. Thus, these paradigms provide the \ufb01rst quantitativephenotypic description of distinct oral pain responses to a common irritant, capsaicin.Perspective: This study examined the time-dependent behavior of pain produced by oral applicationof capsaicin. Three distinct temporal response phenotypes were identi\ufb01ed objectively: level detection,change detection, and cumulative irritation detection. These time-dependent analyses provide a newdimension to understanding individual differences in pain sensation in clinical settings."}
