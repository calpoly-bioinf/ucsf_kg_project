Although useful, analyzing brain relationships with stimulus intensity and\nbehavior separately does not address how sensation and pain are linked in the central nervous system.\nIn this study, we used multi-level mediation analysis to identify brain mediators of pain\u2014regions in\nwhich trial-by-trial responses to heat explained variability in the relationship between noxious stimulus\nintensity (across 4 levels) and pain. This approach has the potential to identify multiple circuits with\ncomplementary roles in pain genesis. Brain mediators of noxious heat effects on pain included targets\nof ascending nociceptive pathways (anterior cingulate, insula, SII, and medial thalamus) and also prefron-\ntal and subcortical regions not associated with nociceptive pathways per se. Cluster analysis revealed that\nmediators were grouped into several distinct functional networks, including the following: somatosen-\nsory, paralimbic, and striatal-cerebellar networks that increased with stimulus intensity; and 2 networks\nco-localized with \u2018\u2018default mode\u2019\u2019 regions in which stimulus intensity-related decreases mediated\nincreased pain. We also identified \u2018\u2018thermosensory\u2019\u2019 regions that responded to increasing noxious heat\nbut did not predict pain reports. Finally, several regions did not respond to noxious input, but their\nactivity predicted pain; these included ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,\ncerebellar regions, and supplementary motor cortices. These regions likely underlie both nociceptive\nand non-nociceptive processes that contribute to pain, such as attention and decision-making processes.\nOverall, these results elucidate how multiple distinct brain systems jointly contribute to the central\ngeneration of pain.\n\n\ufffd 2014 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction\n\nThe relationship between stimulus intensity and perception\nis lawful and robust in all perceptual domains, including pain\n[2,72]. However, although higher stimulus intensities usually lead\nto greater pain, there is nearly always variability in the stimulus\u2013\nresponse relationship. Pain perception is strongly influenced by\nspontaneous fluctuations in arousal and attention [14,46,62], stim-\nulus history [12,37,64], and other factors. Thus, a given stimulus\nintensity can be perceived or reported as painful or nonpainful\ndepending on brain activity before [14,62], during [63], or after\nnoxious stimulation [9,44]. The purpose of the present study was\nto examine how variations in noxious stimulus intensity are\ntransformed into variations in pain, focusing specifically on\nresponses during noxious stimulation itself. In particular, we\nsought to identify regions that mediate stimulus effects on pain\nand those that do not respond strongly to noxious stimuli but\nnonetheless play supporting roles in pain genesis.\n\nTargets of spino-thalamo-cortical nociceptive pathways [32]\nand other nociceptive pathways (eg, spino-parabrachial and spi-\nno-reticular [83]) reliably track the stimulus intensity of painful\nevents in human neuroimaging studies, including somatosensory\n(SI/SII), dorsal posterior [dpINS], anterior insular [aIns], and ante-\nrior cingulate [aCC] cortices and thalamus [5,35,60]. There is broad\nconsensus that these \u2018\u2018intensity coding\u2019\u2019 regions also generally cor-\nrelate with pain [25,76], although the stimulus\u2013response function\nbetween brain response and pain report may differ depending on\nthe region [15,20,38,48,63].\n\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1016/j.pain.2014.05.015&domain=pdf\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pain.2014.05.015\nmailto:lauren.atlas@nih.gov\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/pain\n\n\nL.Y. Atlas et al. / PAIN\n\ufffd\n\n155 (2014) 1632\u20131648 1633\nHowever, only a few studies have directly compared brain\nactivity related to stimulus processing with activity related to pain,\nand findings are mixed on which areas are most strongly associ-\nated with each. One seminal study found that dpINS correlated\npreferentially with stimulus intensity and that aIns correlated pref-\nerentially with perceived pain [29], whereas another study found\nthe opposite [6]. In addition, these previous studies do not provide\nmodels of how stimulus-related brain activity and pain-related\nbrain activity are linked. Although these studies identify correlates\nof either noxious stimulus intensity or pain perception, we know\nlittle about the brain processes that transform stimulus processing\ninto pain, and which processes might contribute to pain indepen-\ndent of stimulus processing.\n\nWe used whole-brain multi-level mediation analysis [7,80,81],\na linear multivariate approach that relates stimuli, brain\nresponses, and behavior in a single model, to understand the\npathways that mediate the effects of noxious input on pain per-\nception. We identified 3 classes of relevant brain processes: (1)\nmediator regions that link stimulus intensity with pain; (2) ther-\nmosensory regions that respond specifically to noxious input; and\n(3) pain-related regions that contribute to decisions about pain\nabove and beyond the linear and nonlinear effects of noxious\nstimulus intensity and thus may reflect endogenous decision-\nmaking processes that contribute to variations in pain, such as\narousal, attention, and magnitude estimation. We identify net-\nworks with distinct functional properties related to pain genesis,\nwhich could help create a clearer picture of the multiple systems\ninvolved in creating pain. This approach could also serve as a\nmodel for understanding sensory decision making in other per-\nceptual modalities.\n\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Participants and procedure\n\n2.1.1. Participants\nThirty healthy, right-handed participants were enrolled in the\n\nstudy. Participants were recruited from the New York metropolitan\narea through posted flyers, advertisements on Craigslist, and if they\nhad previously participated in studies in our laboratory and volun-\nteered to be contacted for future research. All participants provided\ninformed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,\nas approved by the Columbia University Institutional Review\nBoard. Preliminary eligibility was assessed with a general health\nquestionnaire, a pain safety screening form, and a functional mag-\nnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) safety screening form. Participants\nreported no history of psychiatric, neurological, or pain disorders.\nThree participants completed calibration but did not undergo\nscanning because of technical problems with the heat equipment\n(2 participants) or discomfort with the MR environment (1 partic-\nipant). The fMRI imaging sequence was incorrect for 1 additional\nparticipant, leaving a final sample of 26 participants (9 female\nand 17 male, mean age = 27.8 years, range: 20\u201350 years).\n\n2.1.2. Thermal stimulation and pain ratings\nThermal stimulation was delivered to the volar surface of the\n\nleft (nondominant) inner forearm using a 16 \ufffd 16-mm Peltier ther-\nmode (Medoc, Inc.). Each stimulus lasted 10 seconds, with 1.5-sec-\nond ramp-up and ramp-down periods and 7 seconds at target\ntemperature. Temperatures were individually calibrated for each\nparticipant using an adaptive staircase procedure. During calibra-\ntion and during the fMRI portion of the experiment, participants\nrated stimulation on a continuous scale from 0 to 8 (0 = no sensa-\ntion; 1 = nonpainful warmth; 2 = low pain; 5 = moderate pain;\n8 = maximum tolerable pain). This scale has been used in previous\nstudies in our laboratory [7,8] and provides measures of pain\nthreshold and tolerance. It is similar to the 0 to 5 scale used by\nBornhovd et al. [15] and Buchel et al. [20] but provides a broader\nrange to increase sensitivities to subtle variations in perception.\nWe used a continuous visual analogue scale (VAS) during fMRI\nscanning, which provided further sensitivity to small fluctuations\nin pain.\n\nThe calibration procedure allowed us to derive each partici-\npant\u2019s stimulus\u2013response curve for the relationship between\napplied thermal stimulation and reported pain, and to identify sites\non the forearm with similar nociceptive profiles (ie, the 3 with the\nlowest average residuals based on the predicted stimulus\u2013\nresponse function). During the fMRI experiment, heat was applied\nto the 3 sites that responded most similarly to changes in temper-\nature, and temperatures were selected for each individual based\nhis or her dose\u2013response curve. Institutional review board restric-\ntions precluded us from applying temperatures higher than 48\ufffdC,\nso all participants were required to have maximum tolerable pain\nlevels fall within the range of 42\ufffdC to 48\ufffdC. One participant\nexceeded this range (maximum predicted temperature based on\ncalibration, 50\ufffdC) but was included in the experiment and received\na maximum stimulus of 48\ufffdC. No participants reported maximum\ntolerable pain that fell below 42\ufffdC.\n\n2.1.3. fMRI task design\nfMRI images were acquired during 6 functional runs (8 trials\n\nper run, 48 trials). The thermode was placed on a different skin\nsite for each run, with 2 total runs per skin site. The task design\nis shown in Fig. 1. At the start of each trial, a square appeared in\nthe center of the screen for 50 milliseconds, followed by a pair of\nfaces [34]. An emotional expression (Happy or Fearful) was\npresented for 33 milliseconds, masked by a neutral face pre-\nsented for 1467 milliseconds. Face cues were evenly crossed with\ntemperature.\n\nAs the conceptual focus of the present article concerns the\nmechanisms that link changes in temperature with changes in\npain, our mediation analyses collapse across the face cues to\nexamine pain-evoked responses during noxious stimulation period\nas a function of temperature. To test whether face primes were\nignorable here, we controlled for the effects of face cues (main\neffects and interactions with temperature) on regions identified\nin our mediation analysis. This assessed the possibility that\nmasked emotional faces induced variability in the temperature\u2013\npain relationship. No main effects of face primes were found on\nthe regions that we report here, and all results reported were sig-\nnificant after controlling for face prime identity; thus, we do not\nreport priming effects in detail. A full analysis of the face primes\nis awaiting replication and extension in future experiments, and\nis not the main focus of this article.\n\nCue presentation was followed by a 6-second anticipatory inter-\nval during which a fixation cross was presented on the screen.\nThermal stimulation was then delivered via the thermode for 10\nseconds (1.5-second ramp up from baseline [32\ufffdC], 7 seconds at\npeak destination temperature, 1.5-second return to baseline) at\nlevels calibrated to elicit ratings of nonpainful warmth (VAS rat-\ning = 1; mean = 40.8\ufffdC, standard deviation [SD] = 2.03), low pain\n(VAS rating = 3; mean = 43.1\ufffdC, SD = 2.10), medium pain (VAS rat-\ning = 5; mean = 45.1\ufffdC, SD = 1.79), or high pain (VAS rating = 7;\nmean = 47.0\ufffdC, SD = 1.14). After thermal stimulation, a fixation\ncross was presented for a 14-second fixed interstimulus interval\n(ISI). The words \u2018\u2018How painful?\u2019\u2019 then appeared on the screen for\n4 seconds above an 8-point VAS. Participants rated the pain evoked\nby the preceding stimulus using an fMRI-compatible track-ball\n(Resonance Technologies, Inc.) with resolution equivalent to the\nscreen resolution (ie, approximately 600 discrete values between\n\n\n\nFig. 1. Task and analysis framework. (A) Task design. On each trial, participants saw a cue, followed by a 6-second anticipatory delay. They then experienced 10 seconds of\nnoxious thermal stimulation at temperatures calibrated to elicit ratings of nonpainful warmth, low pain, moderate pain, or high pain. After a delay, participants rated the pain\nthat they had experienced. Analyses examine brain responses during noxious stimulation, using area under the curve (AUC) as a measure of evoked response. (B) Multi-level\nmediation analysis. Our mediation analyses use linear mixed models to examine the dynamic, trial-by-trial relationship between objective stimulus (left, X; temperature),\nvoxelwise stimulus-evoked responses (bottom, M; AUC estimates from single trial analysis), and pain experience (right, Y; pain report). The 4 components of multilevel\nmediation analysis address the current study\u2019s key questions. Top, path c/c0 \u2019: Does temperature affect perceived pain as measured by trial-by-trial pain reports? Path c reflects\nthe total relationship between predictive cue and reported pain on medium trials, and path c0 reflects the direct behavioral relationship, controlling for activity in the\nmediator\u2014in this case, a brain voxel or region. Left: Path a (\u2018\u2018Temperature effects\u2019\u2019) provides inferences on whether brain voxels are modulated by noxious input (Fig. 2A).\nRight: Path b (\u2018\u2018report-related responses\u2019\u2019) provides inferences on whether brain activity in each voxel predicts trial-by-trial pain reports, controlling for temperature (Fig. 2B).\nTo supplement the standard linear model, we controlled for nonlinear effects of temperature when assessing path b. Middle: The mediation effect (c \u2013 c0) provides inferences\non whether brain voxels explain a significant amount of the covariance between temperature and perceived pain (Figs. 3 and 4). (C) Pain-processing brain network. We were\nmost interested in testing for effects within the a priori pain-processing brain network. We created an independent localizer using a mega-analytic approach across 4\ndifferent studies of noxious thermal stimulation (n = 114; see Methods) to identify regions associated with pain and nociception.\n\n1634 L.Y. Atlas et al. / PAIN\n\ufffd\n\n155 (2014) 1632\u20131648\n1 and 8). The delay between pain offset and rating was included to\nmaximize our ability to isolate pain-period responses using single-\ntrial analysis. A 10-second ISI separated the rating period from the\nstart of the next trial.\n\nIn this report, we focus on brain responses evoked during the\n10-second thermal stimulation period. Anticipatory responses\nand responses during the pain rating period were analyzed and\nreported for a subset of participants, along with heat-evoked\nresponses, in a separate study [78] that used qualitatively different\nmethods (pattern classification, rather than mediation analysis)\nand thus provides complementary findings.\n\n2.1.4. Behavioral analyses\nBehavioral data were analyzed using custom code implement-\n\ning a linear mixed-effects model in Matlab software (MathWorks,\nNatick, MA), and verified using the Mixed procedure in SAS 9.1\n(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We modeled within-subject effects of\nTemperature and Masked Emotion prime on pain report, as well\nas the Temperature \ufffdMasked Emotion interaction. To test for non-\nlinear effects of temperature on pain, we log-transformed temper-\natures and ratings and tested a linear mixed-effects model in log\nspace.\n2.2. fMRI acquisition and preprocessing\n\n2.2.1. Imaging acquisition\nWhole-brain fMRI data were acquired on a 1.5-T GE Signa Twin\n\nSpeed Excite HD scanner (GE Medical Systems) at Columbia Uni-\nversity\u2019s Program for Imaging in Cognitive Science. Functional\nimages were acquired with an echo-planar imaging sequence\n(TR = 2000 ms, TE = 34 ms, field of view = 224 mm, 64 \ufffd 64 matrix,\n3.5 \ufffd 3.5 \ufffd 4.0-mm voxels, 29 slices). Each run lasted 6 minutes\nand 18 seconds (189 TRs). Stimulus presentation and data acquisi-\ntion were controlled using E-Prime software (PST Inc.).\n\n2.2.2. Preprocessing\nBefore preprocessing, we identified global outlier time points by\n\ncomputing both the mean and the SD of values in each image for\neach slice. Mahalanobis distances for the matrix of mean values\n(1 per slice) \ufffd functional volumes were computed, and images\nwith a value greater than 3 SDs were considered to be outliers.\nThe same procedure was used for SD values. Outlier time points\nwere modeled as indicator vectors at the level of single trial esti-\nmation (see below, \u2018\u2018Single trial analysis\u2019\u2019). We also used principal\ncomponents analysis (PCA) as an approach to noise reduction,\n\n\n\nL.Y. Atlas et al. / PAIN\n\ufffd\n\n155 (2014) 1632\u20131648 1635\nusing methods similar to previous work [74,75]. In brief, standard\nPCA was used to define 10 components expressed across the brain.\nA task-related design matrix was created using the timing of the\nfMRI paradigm. Cue, heat, and rating onsets were modeled with\nboxcars representing event duration and convolved with SPM\u2019s\ncanonical hemodynamic response function plus time and disper-\nsion derivatives. A nuisance-related design matrix was also con-\nstructed from the time series of global outlier time points and\nmotion parameters. For each run, task- and nuisance-related\npredictors were regressed on each component time series, which\nprovided correlation coefficients for how nuisance related or task\nrelated each component was. The ratio between correlation coeffi-\ncients was used as a first step in determining whether each compo-\nnent was artifactual and should be removed: No components were\nremoved that had a task-related R2 value greater than 0.1, or\nwhose ratio of nuisance-to-task was less than 2.0. Components\nthat fit these criteria were then visualized both spatially (pattern\nof weights across voxels) and temporally (average activity across\ntime). Trained research assistants carefully inspected the compo-\nnents, and removed only those components that were clearly\nartifactual (eg, those expressed only at the edge of the brain, those\nthat included an obvious single spike, etc.). An average of 1.09\ncomponents per run was removed per subject (SD = 0.69).\n\nAfter PCA denoising, functional images were slice-acquisition-\ntiming and motion corrected using FSL (FMRIB\u2019s Software Library;\nhttp://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/). Structural T1-weighted images\nwere coregistered to the first functional image for each subject\nusing an iterative procedure of automated registration using\nmutual information coregistration in SPM5 (Wellcome Trust\nCentre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) and manual adjustment of\nthe automated algorithm\u2019s starting point until the automated pro-\ncedure provided satisfactory alignment. Data were smoothed with\nan 8-mm\u2013full width at half maximum Gaussian smoothing kernel\nusing SPM5.\n\nStructural images were normalized to MNI space using a genetic\nalgorithm (GA)\u2013based normalization. This approach is a refine-\nment of the standard SPM5 warping and improves intersubject\nregistration, and is described in detail elsewhere [7]. We note that\nbecause we started with a group mean registered to MNI space, the\nresulting warped images were still registered with MNI space.\nNormalized functional images were interpolated to 2 \ufffd 2 \ufffd 2-mm\nvoxels.\n\n2.3. fMRI analysis\n\n2.3.1. Single trial analysis\nWe used single trial analysis to elicit a measure of brain\n\nresponse (eg., area under the curve) to each trial, in each voxel,\nfor each subject. Our method is described in detail elsewhere [7].\nIn brief, we quantified single-trial response magnitudes by con-\nstructing a GLM design matrix with separate regressors for each\ntrial, as in the \u2018\u2018beta series\u2019\u2019 approach of Rissman et al. [67]. How-\never, we used a flexible basis set to model each trial, thus allowing\nthe shape of the modeled hemodynamic response function (HRF)\nto vary across trials and voxels. The basis set consisted of 3 curves\nshifted in time and was customized for thermal pain responses\nbased on previous studies [47]. The positions of the 3 basis func-\ntions were fixed in time relative to trial onset, and we allowed\namplitude to vary to construct a fitted response on each trial. We\nevaluated the height, duration, delay-to-peak, and area under the\ncurve (AUC) of each trialwise fitted response. We chose to use\nthe AUC of each fitted response (for each trial within each voxel)\nas a summary estimate of pain-period activity, as noxious heat\nhas been shown to influence not only amplitude but also the dura-\ntion of the evoked HRF [47], and thus the AUC captures these joint\neffects better than standard beta regressor amplitudes. When using\na single-trial approach, it is common for some trials to be contam-\ninated by movement or other artifacts. To mitigate such artifacts,\nwe calculated trial-by-trial variance inflation factors (a measure\nof design-induced uncertainty due, in this case, to collinearity with\nnuisance regressors). Any trials with variance inflation factors\nthat exceeded 2 or whose whole-brain AUC estimates exceeded 3\nSDs from the mean were excluded from subsequent analyses\n(mean = 2.69, SD = 2.07, range = 0\u20137 trials per participant).\n\n2.3.2. Mediation analysis\nWe used whole-brain multi-level mediation to examine the\n\nrelationship between trial-by-trial changes in temperature (X),\nheat-evoked responses within a voxel (M), and reported pain (Y),\nas illustrated in Fig. 1. Our methods have been described in detail\nin previous work [7,80,81]. The mediation approach is complemen-\ntary to recent attempts to develop pain-predictive brain patterns\nusing machine learning [16,18,52,66,78]. Whereas machine learn-\ning integrates activity across many regions into patterns that\npredict a single outcome variable (eg, pain reports), the present\nmultivariate approach relates responses within voxels to both\nnoxious input and pain. We then address the complexity of these\nrelationships by identifying multiple networks that make separate\ncontributions to pain (see \u2018\u2018Network analysis,\u2019\u2019 below).\n\nThe mediation analysis presented here includes the following\ntests: (1) whether changes in temperature influence activation\nwithin a voxel (measured by AUC) during heat (path a); (2)\nwhether heat-evoked responses are correlated with pain reports,\ncontrolling for temperature (path b); and (3) whether the overall\nrelationship between temperature and pain report (path c)\ndecreases when controlling for heat-evoked responses within a\nvoxel [c-c0, equivalent to a\u2044b+cov(a,b)]. This final test is a test of\nmediation. The interpretation of a mediator is that there is an indi-\nrect pathway through this region that links changes in external\nstimuli with subjective responses, and that if a mediator were dis-\nrupted, the stimulus\u2013response relationship would be diminished\nor abolished entirely.\n\nWe used bootstrap tests to test the significance of the mediation\neffect and each individual path. Bootstrap testing provides a more\nsensitive test of mediation than the Sobel test [13,33,71,73]. We\ntested the significance of all effects (a, b, and a\ufffdb) using a bias-\ncorrected, accelerated bootstrap [33]. We estimated distributions\nof subject level path coefficients by randomly sampling with\nreplacement 10,000 observations (rows) from the matrix of [a b\na\ufffdb] path coefficients for each voxel. Two-tailed, uncorrected P\nvalues were calculated from the bootstrap confidence interval.\n\nMulti-level mediation analysis incorporates a critical compo-\nnent, not present in single-level mediation, that offers a novel\nperspective on the relationship between within- and between-\nsubject effects. The mediation effect (the decrease in the behavioral\nrelationship when controlling for a mediator) is driven by a combi-\nnation of consistent effects (paths a and b) across a group of sub-\njects and by covariance between paths a and b across individuals\n[39]\u2014that is, the individuals that show strongly positive path a\neffects also show strongly positive path b effects, and vice versa.\nThis implies that a region can mediate the relationship between\nindependent and dependent variables either because it is used in\nsimilar ways by all subjects (eg, the region shows increases with\ntemperature [path a] and greater activation predicts higher pain\ncontrolling for temperature [path b]) or because individuals vary\nin consistent ways across paths a and b (eg, for subjects who show\nincreases with temperature, greater activation predicts higher\npain, and for subjects who show decreases with temperature, less\nactivation predicts higher pain). The notion of mediation driven by\ncovariance is relevant because individuals vary in the magnitude of\npain that they report with a given stimulus temperature in mean-\ningful ways [24,56,84]. These person-level differences are often\n\nhttp://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/\n\n\n1636 L.Y. Atlas et al. / PAIN\n\ufffd\n\n155 (2014) 1632\u20131648\nlikely to be psychologically meaningful; for instance, individuals\nmay use different strategies to cope with pain.\n\nTo examine whether mediation was driven by consistent effects\nacross the group or by covariance between temperature effects and\npain-related responses, we identified clusters that showed evi-\ndence of mediation, and extracted trialwise data from each subject\nwithin each cluster. We then tested whether there were significant\neffects across the group in paths a and b (ie, whether there was a\nconsistent group effect, essentially identical to what would be\nfound with a standard 1-sample t test on path a or path b coeffi-\ncients), or whether there were significant correlations between a\nand b coefficients across individuals. The former are reported as\nmediators that show consistent effects, whereas the latter are\nreported as driven by covariance and are likely to reflect psycho-\nlogically meaningful individual differences, although identifying\nthe sources and psychological correlates of these individual differ-\nences likely requires large-sample studies and is beyond the scope\nof the present report.\n\n2.3.3. Thresholding\nAll results are false discovery rate (FDR) corrected at q < 0.05,\n\nwhich corresponds to a voxelwise threshold of P < .001 for the\nmediation effect, and a threshold of P < .003 for the conjunction\nacross all 3 maps (a, b, a\ufffdb). We imposed a cluster extent threshold\nof 3 voxels at the lowest threshold. Network analyses and cluster-\nwise tests were performed on data extracted from these voxels\nalong with any contiguous voxels at uncorrected thresholds of\nP < .005 and P < .01.\n\nWe were specifically interested in characterizing responses\nwithin regions classically associated with pain-related processing\n[5,35,60]. We used an independent localizer to identify pain-\nprocessing brain network (PPBN) regions of interest (ROIs), using\nmethods similar to those previously reported [7]. In brief, we used\na mega-analytic approach to compare high- versus low-intensity\nthermal stimulation across 4 different studies from our laboratory\n(n = 114). Voxels that showed a significant [high \u2013 low intensity]\neffect on the basis of familywise error correction (P < .05) using\nGaussian random fields as implemented in SPM5 (Fig. 1C) were\ndefined as the PPBN. Anatomical localization was determined\nbased on the LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas [70]. This revealed\nthe following regions as comprising the PPBN (Fig. 1C): bilateral\nsuperior, inferior, and middle frontal gyrus; bilateral precentral\ngyrus; right middle and bilateral lateral orbitofrontal gyrus; bilat-\neral postcentral gyrus; bilateral supramarginal gyrus; bilateral\nsuperior and middle temporal gyrus; right hippocampus; right\nparahippocampal gyrus; left lingual gyrus; bilateral insular cortex;\nbilateral cingulate gyrus; bilateral caudate; bilateral putamen;\nbrainstem; cerebellum, bilateral thalamus, and medial thalamus.\nFor each path, we report results from ROIs that fell within the PPBN\nlocalizer, as well as regions outside the a priori PPBN.\n\n2.3.4. Relationship to stimulus versus report\nWe tested for selectivity to temperature effects or variations in\n\npain report by identifying voxels that were activated by tempera-\nture but unrelated to variations in report (ie, showed path a effects\nbut neither path b effects nor mediation), and voxels that showed\nthe reverse relationship (path b effects but neither path a effects\nnor mediation). To ensure specificity to one process over the other,\nwe identified voxels that showed significant effects in one path at\nP < .001, and whose P values for the other path effect and the medi-\nation effect exceeded P > .05 uncorrected.\n\nWithin path b regions, we also tested for specificity to pain\nreport and independence from nociceptive responses by testing\nwhether brain regions predicted pain controlling for temperature,\nas well as brain responses in mediators that fell within the bound-\naries of the PPBN. Trial-by-trial AUC estimates were averaged\nacross PPBN mediator regions and included as covariates in multi-\nlevel mediation analyses for each path b region (activation\naveraged across all voxels). This in turn allowed us to test the rela-\ntionship between brain response and pain report controlling for\nboth temperature and PPBN mediator response. Results are\nreported in Table 2.\n\n2.3.5. Network analysis\nWe used dimension reduction with nonmetric multidimen-\n\nsional scaling (NMDS) and clustering to test whether mediator\nregions grouped into separate networks, using a multisubject\nextension of methods described in previous work [40,79]. We\nextracted the entire series of trial AUC estimates for each subject\nfor each voxel within each mediator region. The goal was to pro-\nvide a reasonable estimate of which voxels were grouped into\ncoherent parcels (contiguous regions) and how these regions\ngrouped into functional networks. A detailed explanation of the\nsteps is provided below; in addition, the code for the analysis is\navailable on our Web site (http://wagerlab.colorado.edu/tools).\nThe function parcel_clusters.m in the CANlab Core Tools package\nimplements the 3 major steps described below and visualized in\nFig. 2:\n\n1. Dimension reduction:\nClustering of multivariate data is most stable when the data are\nnot sparse, that is, the dimensionality is low relative to the\nnumber of observations. To limit the dimensionality of the data,\na spatio-temporal dimension-reduction step is first performed\non the [n \ufffd v \ufffd N] data matrix of AUC data for n trials \ufffd v vox-\nels \ufffd N participants (here, n = 48 trials [usually], v = 17,112\nvoxels, and N = 26 participants). A temporal data reduction is\nfirst performed to identify components with correlated AUC\ntrial time series within each participant, followed by a spatial\nreduction to identify components with correlated spatial pat-\nterns across subjects. First, the [n \ufffd v] matrix of AUC data for\neach participant was subjected to PCA, using the [v \ufffd v] corre-\nlation matrices. Based on the scree plots across subjects, we\nsaved the first 7 eigenvectors (spatial maps). These eigenvectors\nexplained 74 \u00b1 2.5% (SD across subjects) of the variance in the\nfull dataset. These eigenvectors were scaled by their variances\n(eigenvalues) and concatenated across subjects to form an\n[v \ufffd N\u20447] matrix of eigenvectors. This matrix was subjected to\na second (across participant) PCA step to identify components\nwith similar spatial maps across participants. We retained 12\neigenvectors (maps) based on the scree plot, which explained\n65% of the variance across individuals. Component scores in this\nspace were used for clustering. This is a data reduction step, and\nthe results are not expected to depend strongly on the number\nof eigenvectors retained at either step, as long as most of the\nvariance in the data is explained.\n\n2. Parcellation:\nHierarchical agglomerative clustering with average linkage was\nused to group voxels into parcels\u2014sets of contiguous voxels\nwith similar profiles\u2014in the [v \ufffd 12] matrix of component\nmaps. The goal of parcellation was to reduce the space from\nvoxels to parcels (regions) for nonmetric multidimensional\nscaling (NMDS)\u2013based clustering of regions, so that NMDS is\ncomputationally tractable. Voxels whose trial AUC time series\ndid not correlate with that of other voxels in the same parcel\nat P < .001 (in a random effects analysis across participants)\nwere pruned from each parcel. Of 140 parcels total, 127 parcels\nwith more than 3 voxels after pruning were retained for subse-\nquent analysis.\n\n3. NMDS and clustering:\nParcels were now treated as the unit of analysis, and the AUC\ntrial time series data were extracted from each parcel for each\n\n\n\nTable 1\nPath a: Regions correlated with stimulation temperature.\n\nBrain region (Brodmann area) Coordinates (mm) No. of\nvoxels\n\nVolume\n(mm)\n\nMax z\nscore\n\nMean\n\nx y z P < .001 Path a coeff\n(SE)\n\nMean p\nvalue path\na\n\nTemperature-related increases\nBilateral cerebellum \u201314 \u201366 \u201334 6081 48,648 15.13 0.9010 (0.17) .0000\nRight temporal pole 48 \u201322 \u201336 6 48 5.86 0.0774 (0.03) 0.0026\nRight insula, contiguous with bilateral thalamus, midbrain, right inferior frontal\n\ngyrus, Right lateral PFC, right premotor cortex, right lateral OFC, Right\nhippocampus\n\n36 2 8 12180 97,440 17.22 0.9217 (0.12) .0001\n\nRight inferior frontal gyrus p. orbitalis, contiguous with right anterior insula and\nRight VLPFC\n\n26 14 \u201324 12 96 5.45 0.4488 (0.17) .0087\n\nLeft middle orbital Gyrus \u201326 38 \u201320 84 672 11.18 0.6833 (0.18) .0002\nLeft middle orbital Gyrus \u201322 58 \u201316 38 304 6.26 0.8102 (0.34) .0050\nRight middle temporal gyrus 58 \u201340 \u201310 43 344 8.87 0.4104 (0.12) .0006\nLeft rolandic operculum \u201346 \u20134 10 3654 29,232 13.63 0.8228 (0.10) .0002\nLeft calcarine gyrus (BA17) 2 \u201384 0 416 3328 10.26 0.9811 (0.25) .0003\nRight calcarine Gyrus (BA17) 16 \u2013102 \u20134 18 144 5.9 0.3819 (0.15) .0043\nCerebellar vermis 4/5 2 \u201346 \u20132 106 848 13.82 1.2624 (0.42) .0000\nLeft insula lobe (OP2) \u201338 \u201318 14 54 432 12.09 0.4722 (0.13) .0001\nRight middle cingulate cortex (BA6) 6 6 44 5699 45,592 19.94 0.8975 (0.12) .0002\nLeft middle frontal gyrus \u201338 42 28 320 2560 10.1 0.7566 (0.17) .0016\nRight middle frontal gyrus 38 50 28 18 144 5.62 0.8758 (0.30) .0037\nLeft caudal cingulate \u201318 \u201328 34 55 440 8.06 0.4528 (0.13) .0003\nLeft inferior parietal lobule (hIP2) \u201344 \u201342 36 6 48 6.27 0.3704 (0.15) .0019\nLeft precuneus \u20136 \u201380 54 4 32 5.21 0.5817 (0.25) .0100\nLeft superior frontal gyrus (BA6) \u201318 4 66 238 1904 12.39 0.2750 (0.07) .0000\nRight superior Parietal lobule 24 \u201346 70 367 2936 13.42 0.2867 (0.07) .0001\n\nTemperature-related decreases\nRight medial Temporal pole 44 12 \u201342 30 240 6.62 \u20130.5364 (0.18) .0006\nLeft hippocampus, contiguous with parahippocampal gyrus left medial temporal lobe,\n\nleft occipital cortex\n\u201334 \u201354 \u20138 7155 57,240 10.95 \u20130.7752 (0.10) .0006\n\nRight hippocampus, contiguous with parahippocampal gyrus and right occipital\ncortex\n\n40 \u201364 2 5973 47,784 11.59 \u20130.8269 (0.14) .0005\n\nRight medial Temporal pole 54 14 \u201332 2 16 4.87 \u20130.6793 (0.27) .0084\nRight middle temporal gyrus 58 \u20138 \u201316 429 3432 10.36 \u20130.9178 (0.21) .0001\nRight amygdala 14 2 \u201328 4 32 5.71 \u20130.4142 (0.14) .0016\nLeft rectal gyrus \u20136 14 \u201324 22 176 7.02 \u20130.3120 (0.09) .0005\nRight inferior Temporal gyrus 66 \u201324 \u201326 3 24 5.02 \u20130.1715 (0.06) .0033\nLeft superior medial gyrus \u20134 54 4 1634 13,072 9.44 \u20130.9172 (0.20) .0047\nLeft rectal gyrus \u20138 24 \u201314 11 88 5.86 \u20130.4067 (0.14) .0034\nRight cerebelum IV\u2013V 10 \u201356 \u201312 4 32 4.86 \u20130.5879 (0.22) .0075\nLeft inferior frontal gyrus p. orbitalis \u201354 24 \u20134 42 336 6.96 \u20130.7147 (0.23) .0013\nRight precuneus 2 \u201344 44 2458 19,664 11.26 \u20130.7598 (0.13) .0001\nLeft superior frontal gyrus \u201318 62 2 6 48 5.28 \u20130.4488 (0.17) .0078\nRight superior temporal gyrus 44 \u201328 4 33 264 7.57 \u20130.3953 (0.11) .0002\nRight calcarine gyrus (BA18) 22 \u201358 8 13 104 6.52 \u20130.6114 (0.21) .0052\nRight precentral gyrus (BA1) 52 \u201314 46 1377 11,016 10.94 \u20130.7646 (0.15) .0004\nLeft postcentral gyrus (BA3b) \u201340 \u201332 52 3869 30,952 11.1 \u20130.7422 (0.13) .0014\nRight superior frontal gyrus 22 36 38 350 2800 9.41 \u20130.5574 (0.13) .0003\nLeft middle frontal gyrus \u201340 10 50 122 976 7.41 \u20130.5397 (0.16) .0011\nLeft middle frontal gyrus \u201326 24 46 138 1104 8.49 \u20130.8461 (0.25) .0009\n\nCoeff, coefficient; Max, maximum; OFC, orbitofrontal cortex; PFC, prefrontal cortex; SE, standard error; VLPFC,\nThis table presents results from path a of the multilevel mediation analysis presented as a path diagram in Fig. 1.

Values in the [n trials \ufffd parcels \ufffd N subjects] data matrix\nwere z scored within participant to remove intersubject differ-\nences in scaling, then concatenated into an [n\u2044N \ufffd parcels] data\nmatrix.

The NMDS stress plot (which operates on\nranked distances and is therefore more robust to outliers and\ndoes not require a strictly Euclidean distance space) was exam-\nined, and 7 dimensions (which explained 79% of the variance in\ndistances) were retained for the final cluster analysis.\nHierarchical agglomerative clustering with average linkage was\nused to cluster the parcels in this space into interconnected\nnetworks with correlated AUC trial time series. To choose the\nnumber of clusters in the final solution (k), for every possible\nchoice of clusters between k = 2 and 20, we compared the clus-\nter solution to the average and SD of 1000 clustering iterations\nwith permuted parcel time series.

Atlas et al. / PAIN\n\ufffd\n\n155 (2014) 1632\u20131648 1639\n2.3.6. Accounting for potential nonlinearities\nRecent work demonstrates that noxious stimulus effects on\n\nbrain responses may be nonlinear with respect to temperature\n[38] and that some regions show nonlinear relationships with\nrespect to pain [15,19,48]. Nonlinearities in the relationship\nbetween temperature and pain are one of the effects that decouple\nstimulus intensity from reported pain, along with others (sequence\nand learning effects, attention, and variance related to decision-\nmaking processes). Our primary analysis controlled for linear effects\nof stimulus intensity when assessing the brain relationship with\npain (path b), which allows nonlinear effects of temperature to drive\nsome path b effects. In additional analyses, we ruled out potential\nnonlinear influences of temperature: We assessed path b (reported\npain) and mediation effects controlling for temperature in a non-\nparametric fashion by including covariates for all possible differ-\nences among the 4 discrete levels of heat. To do this, we evaluated\na second mediation in which the input variable (\u2018\u2018X\u2019\u2019) reflected the\ndifference between the top 2 temperatures and the bottom 2\ntemperatures (eg, [11\ufffd1\ufffd1] across the vector of [High pain, Med-\nium pain, Low pain, Warmth] conditions), and we also modeled\ncovariates for the difference between High and Medium conditions\nand Medium and Low conditions. This controls for any pairwise\ndifferences, because any systematic linear or nonlinear differences\namong intensity levels can be modeled as a linear combination\nacross these 3 regressors. The results of these tests are reported in\nTables 2 and 3. Path b effects on all regions remained significant\nafter controlling for nonlinear effects of stimulus intensity.\n\n2.3.7. Relationship to masked emotion face cues\nThe primary focus of this report was to introduce a method to\n\nisolate the brain regions that link changes in noxious input to\nchanges in pain perception. Although our design included masked\npresentations of face stimuli with happy or fearful expressions, iso-\nlating the effects of the faces themselves on brain responses was\noutside the scope of this article. However, mediation analysis takes\nadvantage of the variability in the temperature-to-pain relation-\nship, and, given our experimental design, some proportion of this\nvariance might relate to the emotion face primes. To account for\nthis possibility, Masked Emotion and Emotion \ufffd Temperature\ninteractions were included as covariates in follow-up analyses for\nregions that showed significant path b and mediation effects in\nour primary linear mediation model (similar to the nonparametric\nanalysis above). Results are reported below and included in Tables\n2 and 3.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Behavioral analysis\n\n3.1.1. Behavioral relationship between stimulus and report\nPain reports were highly correlated with noxious stimulus\n\nintensity. The linear mixed model revealed a significant effect of\ntemperature on pain (t25 = 14.45, P < .001), such that pain reports\nincreased by 0.73 points on the VAS scale for each unit change in\ntemperature. The linear effect of temperature on pain is modeled\nas path c in the multilevel mediation analysis (Fig. 1A). As shown\nin Fig. 3, there was also substantial variability in this relationship\n(variance in linear effect of temperature: mean = 1.93, SD = 0.75).\nWe searched for mediators that explained this variance. We also\ntested nonlinear effects of temperature on pain and found that\nthe relationship was captured by a power law with exponent\n2.49, consistent with previous work [65]. We therefore additionally\nmodeled nonparametric effects of temperature for path b and\nmediator regions below.\n\n\n\nTable 3\nPath a \ufffd b: Brain mediators of temperature effects on

The relationship between temperature and pain is reliable. However, there is also substantial variability in this relationship\nboth within and between individuals, as demonstrated by plots of each participant\u2019s pain ratings as a function of temperature. Mediators help to explain the within-subject\nvariability. (A) Variability across subjects. Each participant is represented in a different color. (B) Variability within subjects. Green = nonpainful warmth (calibrated level 1);\nyellow = low pain (calibrated level 3); orange = medium pain (calibrated level 5); red = high pain (calibrated level 7).\n\nL.Y. Atlas et al. / PAIN\n\ufffd\n\n155 (2014) 1632\u20131648 1641\nFinally, we tested whether the masked emotion faces influenced\npain reports. There was no main effect of Masked Emotion (Fear vs\nHappy) on pain (P > .3), however there was a significant Tempera-\nture \ufffdMasked Emotion interaction (t25 = 3.79, P < .001), such that\nthere was a steeper slope in temperature effects on pain when\nstimuli were preceded by subliminal fear faces, relative to sublim-\ninal happy faces. Because this comparison lacks a neutral control\ncondition and requires replication before we interpret it strongly,\nwe cannot make claims about these effects without replication\nand extension in additional experiments. Thus, we do not focus\non these effects here, but we evaluate whether results reported\nbelow remain significant controlling for priming effects due to\nfaces.\n\n3.2. Multilevel mediation analysis\n\nThe mediation analysis (Fig. 1b) included 3 tests of the links\nbetween the objective stimulus and the pain response: (1) path\na, stimulus-related responses; (2) path b, pain-related responses,\ncontrolling for temperature; and (3) path a \ufffd b, mediators of the\nrelationship between stimulus and response, that is, a formal test\nof whether the brain region explains a significant amount of the\ncovariance between temperature and pain.\n\n3.2.1. Path a, stimulus-related activity\nIncreasing temperature produced increases in activation\n\nthroughout the PPBN, including bilateral insula (with contiguous\nactivation covering anterior, middle, and dorsal posterior insula),\nbilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), right primary\nsomatosensory cortex (SI), bilateral medial thalamus, dorsal\nanterior cingulate cortex (dACC; with coverage extending to sup-\nplementary motor area (SMA) and middle cingulate regions), in\nthe midbrain surrounding the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and\nbilateral and medial cerebellum (Fig. 4A and Table 1). Tempera-\nture-related increases were also found in regions outside of the\nPPBN, including bilateral lateral orbitofrontal cortex (latOFC), right\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Mediation analysis results. (A) Path a identifies brain regions that show linear effects of temperature. (B) Path b identifies brain regions that correlate with pain reports,\ncontrolling for temperature. All identified regions were significantly related to trial-by-trial variations in pain using both linear and nonlinear models of temperature-related\nchanges.\n\n1642 L.Y. Atlas et al. / PAIN\n\ufffd\n\n155 (2014) 1632\u20131648\nlateral prefrontal cortex (latPFC), bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal\ncortex (DLPFC), and right caudate.\n\nTemperature was inversely related to blood oxygen level\u2013\ndependent (BOLD) responses in the right dorsomedial prefrontal\ncortex (DMPFC; superior frontal gyrus), ventromedial prefrontal\ncortex (VMPFC), bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral hippo-\ncampus, bilateral primary motor cortex (M1), bilateral fusiform\ngyrus, precuneus, cuneus, subgenual and posterior cingulate cor-\ntex, bilateral middle temporal cortex, and bilateral occipital cortex\n(Table 1). As we describe below, some of these regions were also\nrelated to pain report, and others were not. Path a effects on all\nregions remained significant when Masked Emotion type and the\nEmotion \ufffd Temperature interaction were included as covariates.\n\n3.2.2. Path b, pain-related responses\nfMRI activity in a number of regions in the a priori PPBN mask\n\npredicted pain reports, controlling for temperature (Fig. 4B and\nTable 2), including bilateral anterior and middle insula, bilateral\nSII, right S1, dACC, SMA, right globus pallidus, and bilateral cerebel-\nlum. Other regions outside of the PPBN also positively predicted\npain, including bilateral DLPFC (middle frontal gyrus), bilateral\nlatOFC (middle orbital gyrus), and bilateral superior parietal lobule\n(SPL).\n\nBOLD responses were inversely related to pain reports in\nanother set of other areas, including bilateral parahippocampal\ncortex, right hippocampus, left VMPFC, MPFC, left/lateral OFC\n(inferior frontal gyrus pars orbitalis), rostral anterior cingulate cor-\ntex (rACC), pons, cuneus, bilateral temporal pole, right middle and\ninferior temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and bilateral occipital\ncortex (Table 2).\n\nEvery region that showed significant path b effects remained\nsignificant when we used a nonparametric model of temperature,\nsuggesting that these effects were not driven by nonlinearities with\nrespect to temperature (Table 2). We also evaluated effects control-\nling for the face primes by modeling Masked Emotion and the\nEmotion \ufffd Temperature interaction as covariates (Table 2). All posi-\ntive path b effects remained significant when we controlled for the\neffects of face primes. Although most negative path b regions\nremained significant, path b effects on bilateral temporal pole, rACC,\nand 1 cluster in left VLPFC were no longer significant (Table 2).\nThus, trial-by-trial variations in activity in these regions\npredicted trial-by-trial variations in report, even when tempera-\nture was held constant. As we describe below, some of these\nregions covaried with stimulus temperature and others did not;\nin addition, some predicted pain report even when controlling\nfor activity in PPBN mediators.\n\n3.2.3. Path a \ufffd b, mediation effect\nA number of regions positively mediated the within-subject\n\nrelationship between stimulus intensity and reported pain\n(Fig. 5A and Table 3). Mediation effects in some regions were dri-\nven by consistent effects\u2014that is, significant stimulus-related (path\na) and pain-related effects (path b) across all participants\u2014whereas\nothers were driven by covariance in paths (ie, correlated individual\ndifferences in path a and path b effects). In either case, positive\nmediation implies that activity in this region explains some of\nthe effects of noxious heat on reported pain.\n\nMediator regions that showed consistent effects are illustrated\nin Fig. 5B. In most mediators that fell within the a priori PPBN\nmask, activation both increased with temperature and predicted\npain (ie, positive path a and b; red in Fig. 5B, Table 3). We observed\nthis pattern of effects in bilateral anterior/mid-insula, bilateral SII,\ndACC, left cerebellum, right lateral PFC, right SMA (BA6), right\nsuperior parietal lobule (SPL), and right premotor cortex. In other\nmediator regions (blue in Fig. 5B, Table 3), temperature increases\nproduced deactivation, and greater deactivation predicted greater\npain. Because both path a and path b are negative, the overall\nmediation effect is positive. Such effects were found in included\nbilateral hippocampus and parahippocampus, bilateral inferior\ntemporal gyrus, left medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), bilateral\noccipital cortex, right posterior cingulate cortex, left SPL, and\nprecuneus.\n\nInterestingly, most mediators were driven by covariance\nbetween paths (Fig. 5A and Table 3), including the right parahippo-\ncampus, left latOFC, bilateral latPFC, left caudate, left temporal\npole, right fusiform, left VLPFC (inferior frontal gyrus), right middle\ntemporal gyrus, bilateral retrosplenial cortex, posterior cingulate,\ncuneus, left premotor/lateral PFC, left DLPFC, right DMPFC, right\nSPL, and precuneus. Significant covariance implies systematic het-\nerogeneity across individuals; that is, some participants show\n\n\n\nFig. 5. Brain mediators of the relationship between stimulus and response. (A) Mediators of the relationship between temperature and pain. Brain regions whose responses to\nnoxious stimulation formally mediate the relationship between temperature and pain include those that were activated consistently across the group, as well as those that\nshow covariance between paths. (B) Consistent mediators (significant path a and path b effects across subjects). Regions that were activated consistently across the group\ninclude both regions that showed temperature- and pain-related increases (red), as well as those that showed temperature- and pain-related decreases (blue).\n\nL.Y. Atlas et al. / PAIN\n\ufffd\n\n155 (2014) 1632\u20131648 1643\nstrong path a and path b responses, whereas others are weak on\nboth. Alternatively, there could be interindividual differences in\nthe qualitative nature of the relationship between fMRI activity\nand pain: Some subjects show positive relationships with both\ntemperature and pain, whereas others show negative relationships\nwith both, in the same region. This is possible if, for example, brain\nactivity represents appraisal or attention processes that serve to\nincrease pain in some individuals and mitigate it in others. Thus,\nthese results raise the possibility that different brain models may\nbe appropriate for different groups of individuals.\n\nFinally, we observed negative mediation effects (blue in Fig. 5A;\nTable 3) in the subgenual anterior cingulate/medial orbitofrontal\ncortex (mOFC), left midbrain, and bilateral DMPFC (superior frontal\ngyrus). These findings suggest that some regions contribute to the\nstimulus\u2013response relationship but show responses that go against\nthe overall behavioral effect. These patterns have been described as\nsuppressive effects in the mediation literature [51], and the inter-\npretation is that the temperature\u2013pain relationship would be\nstronger if activity in these regions were held constant. Regions\nin which activation is triggered by increases in temperature, but\nthat serve an endogenous regulatory function, would fit this pat-\ntern; however, we do not interpret these results strongly here, as\nthey were not predicted a priori. Finally, mediation effects in all\nregions remained significant when we controlled for cue effects\nby including Masked Emotion and Emotion \ufffd Temperature as\ncovariates in the mediation analysis (Table 3).\n\n3.3. Relationship to stimulus versus response\n\nAmong the regions with significant temperature-related effects,\nsome did not show any substantial evidence for correlations with\npain report (\u2018\u2018a not b regions\u2019\u2019). Regions positively and uniquely\nrelated to temperature (yellow in Fig. 6) included the right dorsal\nposterior insula, bilateral thalamus, midbrain surrounding the\nPAG, right lateral prefrontal cortex, rostral ACC, bilateral lateral\nOFC, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, caudal anterior cingulate cor-\ntex, and bilateral cerebellum. Regions negatively and uniquely\nrelated to temperature (green in Fig. 6) included bilateral medial\nprefrontal cortex, right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC),\nbilateral primary motor cortex, left S1, precuneus, left hippocam-\npus, bilateral posterior hippocampus/fusiform gyrus, and bilateral\noccipital lobe. Activity in these regions is likely to reflect early pro-\ncessing of the noxious input.\n\nRegions that predict variations in report but are not affected by\nchanges in noxious input (\u2018\u2018b not a regions\u2019\u2019, red/purple in Fig. 6)\nincluded the right mOFC, bilateral DLPFC (BA46), right DMPFC\n(superior frontal sulcus), bilateral SMA, right pre-SMA, left poster-\nior insula, left posterior parahippocampus, bilateral superior parie-\ntal lobule, and bilateral cerebellum. To ensure specificity to pain\nreports, we also tested whether these \u2018\u2018b not a\u2019\u2019 regions predicted\npain report controlling for evoked responses within PPBN mediator\nregions. All regions remained significant controlling for PPBN\nmediator activation (Table 2), and remained significant controlling\nfor nonlinear effects of temperature. These regions are likely to\nrepresent magnitude estimation, attention, decision making, and\nother endogenous processes that relate to variation in report but\nare unaffected by changes in temperature.\n\nInterestingly, we observed qualitative evidence for anterior-\nto-posterior gradients in several regions, pictured in Fig. 6A. In\nthe left insula and ACC, anterior portions were temperature-\nrelated, middle regions showed both temperature and pain effects,\nand posterior regions were pain-related. We found the opposite\n\n\n\nFig. 6. Relationship to stimulus versus response. Regions illustrated in yellow and green were affected by temperature (P < .001) but were unrelated to pain reports,\ncontrolling for temperature (P > .05) and showed no evidence of mediation (P > .05). Red and purple regions were associated with trial-by-trial pain reports, controlling for\ntemperature (P < .001), but showed neither temperature-related changes nor mediation (P > .05), and each was significantly related to variations in pain controlling for\nnonlinear effects of temperature and for activation in the pain-processing brain network (PPBN) mediators. Mediators that showed consistent effects within subjects, with\nsignificant temperature- and pain-related effects, are depicted in orange (all paths: P < .001). (A) We observed anterior-to-posterior gradients in several regions. In the\nanterior cingulate cortex (ACC; left inset) and left insula (right inset), anterior portions were stimulus related; middle regions showed activation that was correlated with both\nincreases in stimulus intensity and increases in pain; and posterior regions were related to pain reports. The opposite pattern was observed in the left parahippocampus\n(middle inset): More posterior portions were related to the stimulus, whereas anterior portions were related to pain reports. (B) Regions related to temperature but not pain\nincluded bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), bilateral primary motor cortex, left S1, precuneus, left hippocampus, bilateral\nposterior hippocampus/fusiform gyrus, bilateral occipital lobe, right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; BA46), right\nsupplementary motor area (SMA), right pre-SMA, left posterior insula, left posterior parahippocampus, and bilateral cerebellum. (C) Regions related to pain but not\ntemperature included right medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), bilateral DLPFC (BA46), right DMPFC, right SMA, right pre-SMA, left posterior insula, left posterior\nparahippocampus, and bilateral cerebellum. (D) We extracted responses from the regions that showed unique relationships to temperature or pain and averaged across\nregions and subjects. Loess curves depict responses as a function of applied temperature (top row), and pain as a function of brain response to heat (area-under-the-curve\n[AUC] estimate), controlling for temperature (bottom row). Shaded regions reflect standard error across subjects and therefore should not be used to make inferences on\nrandom effects.\n\n1644 L.Y.

Mediation by network averages\n\nFinally, we used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to\nidentify networks of mediators expressed similarly across trials\nand across individuals. We averaged across clusters within each\nnetwork and tested for mediation to understand the network\u2019s\nfunctional significance. Three networks showed consistent media-\ntion effects with positive paths a and b (Fig. 7, top panel). The first\nnetwork included bilateral SII; the second network was made up of\nbilateral anterior and middle insula, dorsal anterior cingulate, right\nlatPFC, right premotor cortex, and right VLPFC; and the third net-\nwork included bilateral thalamus, left ventral striatum, midbrain/\nPAG, and bilateral cerebellum. Two other networks showed posi-\ntive mediation effects with negative paths a and b. One network\nincluded bilateral parahippocampal cortex, right hippocampus,\nbilateral middle temporal gyrus/temporoparietal junction (TPJ),\nbilateral temporal pole, and right posterior hippocampus (Fig. 7,\nbottom), and the other network included bilateral retrosplenial\ncortex/posterior cingulate and inferior parietal lobule (IPL).\nNetworks illustrated in Fig. 7 showed evidence of mediation even\ncontrolling for all other mediators, suggesting that they are the\nmost proximal predictors of temperature effects on pain. Finally,\nseven more networks were identified with inconsistent positive\nmediation effects (significant a\u2044b, but nonsignificant path a and/\nor path b effects), likely driven by covariance (individual differ-\nences) and/or heterogeneity of the behavior of the constituent\nregions. All effects are reported in Table 4.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe present study identified brain networks that contribute to\nthe generation of pain in response to noxious stimulation. This pro-\nvides the first direct evidence that regions within an a priori \u2018\u2018pain\n\n\n\nFig. 7. Classes of mediators. We performed nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling to identify networks of mediators, based on functional coactivation within-subjects across\ntrials. Eleven functional networks were identified (Table 4). (Top) Three networks consistently showed temperature- and pain-related increases, including a network in\nbilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (orange), a second network that consisted of bilateral anterior and middle insula, dorsal anterior cingulate, right lateral prefrontal\ncortex (latPFC), right premotor cortex, and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (red), and a third network that included bilateral thalamus, left ventral striatum, midbrain/\nperiaqueductal gray (PAG), and bilateral cerebellum (yellow). Plots of average activation reveal that networks 2 and 3 were largely linear in relationship to noxious input,\nwhereas network 1 showed nonlinearities that mirror the behavioral effects of temperature on pain. (Bottom) Two networks were inversely related to both noxious stimulus\nand pain reports: The first included bilateral retrosplenial cortex/posterior cingulate and inferior parietal lobule (green), and the second included bilateral parahippocampal\ncortex, right hippocampus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus/temporoparietal junction (TPJ), bilateral temporal pole, and right posterior hippocampus (cyan).\n\nL.Y. Atlas et al. / PAIN\n\ufffd\n\n155 (2014) 1632\u20131648 1645\nprocessing\u2019\u2019 brain network (PPBN) formally mediate stimulus\nintensity effects on pain. Our results also reveal complexity that\ngoes beyond a unitary pain-processing system. First, regions out-\nside the PPBN also mediate temperature effects on pain. Second,\nmediators were grouped into several networks that make separa-\nble contributions to pain. Finally, some regions responded selec-\ntively to changes in temperature, whereas others predicted pain\nwithout responding to changes in heat.\n\n4.1. Pain-processing brain network mediators\n\nMost mediators that showed consistent profiles across individ-\nuals fell within a priori ROIs, including bilateral SII, aIns, dACC, left\ncerebellum, IPL, and SPL. These regions showed temperature-\nrelated increases and predicted subtle variations in pain, control-\nling for temperature. Previous work has linked activation in some\nof these regions to variations in reports without changes in stimu-\nlus intensity [7,14,62,82]. Our findings reveal that these regions\ndrive fluctuations in pain even when stimulus intensity varies.\nThese trial-by-trial fluctuations are not reducible to nonlinearities\nin temperature effects on pain [33], but they could reflect sensory\nvariations due to contact with the thermode (which we attempted\nto minimize), stimulus history [12,37,64], or non-nociceptive pro-\ncesses that modify pain, such as fluctuations in attention [14,46,62]\nand regulatory or preparatory mechanisms that reduce pain\n[22,77]. Future studies should distinguish among these possibili-\nties and perhaps quantify how much variance in the brain activ-\nity\u2013pain relationship is due to each factor.\n\nNetwork analyses suggest that PPBN mediators comprise\ndistinct somatosensory, paralimbic cortical (anterior cingulate/\ninsula/lateral sensorimotor/frontal), and subcortical (striatal/\nbrainstem/cerebellar) groups. These findings are broadly consis-\ntent with separation of lateral sensory/discriminative versus med-\nial affective/motivational systems [17], but provide an elaborated\nview. The cortical network that we identified includes lateral and\nmedial areas, and the subcortical regions often included in the\n\u2018\u2018medial pain system\u2019\u2019 form a separate, coherent network. Thus,\nthe results extend the concept of the unitary \u2018\u2018pain processing\u2019\u2019\nsystem, and lay a foundation for (1) understanding how networks\ninteract during pain genesis, and (2) examining how different fac-\ntors (stimulus types, psychological contexts, or treatments) affect\neach network.\n\n4.2. Mediators not targeted by ascending nociceptive pathways\n\nRegions outside the a priori PPBN also mediated pain. We\nobserved temperature- and pain-related increases as well as medi-\nation in the right latPFC, right SMA, right SPL, and right premotor\n\n\n\nTable 4\nMediator networks and relationship to temperature effects on pain.\n\nNetwork components Path a Path b Path c Path c\u2019 Mediation (c \u2013 c\u2019)\n\nConsistent mediator networks: Positive path coefficients\nNetwork 1: Bilateral SII, M1 2.148\u2044 2.387\u2044 3.933\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.953\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.144\u2044\u2044\n\nNetwork 2: Bilateral anterior insula, Bilateral middle insula, dACC, R DMPFC,\nbilateral precentral gyrus, R latPFC, R VLPFC, R SPL\n\n3.747\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.635\u2044\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.652\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.967\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.586\u2044\u2044\u2044\n\nNetwork 3: Right thalamus, PAG, midbrain, medial cerebellum, left ventral striatum,\nventral striatum, right globus pallidus\n\n3.570\u2044\u2044\u2044 2.213\u2044 4.040\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.988\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.078\u2044\u2044\n\nConsistent mediator networks: Negative path coefficients\nNetwork 4: Bilateral retrosplenial cortex, R \u2013 \u2013\nIPL 3.313\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.551\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.979\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.921\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.720\u2044\u2044\u2044\n\nNetwork 5: Bilateral hippocampus, R parahippocampus, bilateral middle\ntemporal gyrus / TPJ, bilateral temporal operculum, L IFG\n\n\u20133.236\u2044\u2044\u2044 \u20131.784\\ 3.937\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.920\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.572\u2044\u2044\u2044\n\nInconsistent mediators: a,b covariance-driven mediation\nNetwork 6: Bilateral VMPFC \u20130.8142 \u20130.196 3.900\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.957\u2044\u2044\u2044 2.826\u2044\u2044\n\nNetwork 7: Bilateral VLPFC, L IFG 0.564 0.266 3.984\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.942\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.677\u2044\u2044\u2044\n\nNetwork 8: Bilateral cerebellum, bilateral latOFC, DMPFC, R DMPFC, L SPL 1.930\ufffd 0.960 3.859\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.917\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.084\u2044\u2044\n\nNetwork 9: Bilateral temporal pole, L anterior PFC, L parahippocampal gyrus \u20132.472\u2044 \u20131.587 3.910\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.935\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.143\u2044\u2044\n\nNetwork 10: Bilateral occipital cortex, posterior parahippocampal cortex, precuneus, R M1 \u20133.814\u2044\u2044\u2044 \u20130.708 3.923\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.943\u2044\u2044\u2044 2.457\u2044\n\nNetwork 11: L pons, cuneus \u20130.706 \u20130.531 3.935\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.944\u2044\u2044\u2044 3.125\u2044\u2044\n\ndACC, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; DMPFC, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex; IFG, ; IPL, inferior parietal lobule; L, left; latOFC, lateral orbitofrontal cortex; lat PFC, lateral\nprefrontal cortex; PAG, periaqueductal gray; PFC, prefrontal cortex; R, right; SPL, superior parietal lobule; TPJ, temporoparietal junction; VLPFC.\nResults of mediation analysis testing whether average network activation mediates temperature effects on pain reports.

Although it is not a direct target of the spino-thalamo-cor-\ntical pathway, right latPFC (near Brodmann Area 10) has been\nimplicated in previous pain studies [10,49,86]. SMA and premotor\nactivation is also commonly observed in imaging studies of neuro-\npathic pain and acute pain in healthy individuals and might be\ninvolved in pain-related motor planning [5,57,59].\n\nTwo core networks, including the hippocampal and parahippo-\ncampal cortex, anterior pole, TPJ, and the precuneus, mediated\nstimulus effects on pain by virtue of deactivation with increasing\nheat, the magnitude of which predicted increased pain. These\nregions are all associated with the \u2018\u2018default mode network\u2019\u2019\n(DMN). They are active at rest and may represent stimulus-\nindependent thought and internally focused mnemonic, viscero-\nmotor, and valuation processes [4,21]. Previous studies have also\nshown intensity- and pain-related DMN deactivation [48,69], link-\ning pain with other processes that capture attention and limit\ninternal thought.\n\nAlthough these temperature- and pain-related decreases may\nreflect pain-related attention capture, some of these regions might\nplay a more active role in pain inhibition and generation. Existing\nevidence suggests that the hippocampus and parahippocampal\ncortices can both enhance or decrease pain. Both receive input\nfrom SII via the insula [36]. Noxious stimuli reduce activation in\nthe hippocampus [43,59] and the parahippocampal gyrus [30,43].\nHippocampal stimulation in animals produces antinociception\n[50,53], and placebo analgesia has been associated with parahippo-\ncampal increases [26,42]. However, noxious stimuli can sometimes\nincrease hippocampal activation [11,30], and hippocampal activity\nhas been associated with anxiety-induced hyperalgesia [61] and\nnocebo-related increases in pain [41]. Disentangling the factors\nthat lead to anti-nociceptive or pro-nociceptive responses is an\nimportant direction for future research.\n\n4.3. Regions preferential to stimulus versus pain report\n\nTests of mediation in single voxels provide an important, but\npartial, view of systems encoding pain. Areas that represent\ndistinct aspects of the experience\u2014that is, selective relationships\nwith temperature or pain\u2014can provide clues about the dissociabil-\nity of nociceptive and decision-making processes and potential\nneurophysiological targets for the modulation of each. For exam-\nple, placebo analgesia is associated with widespread changes in\nresponses to noxious stimuli [78]. It is unclear whether any brain\ncircuits reliably encode thermosensory nociceptive responses\nwithout being affected by the treatment context. This study iden-\ntified potential thermosensory circuits in subcortical (eg, PAG\nand thalamus), sensory cortex, and fronto-cerebellar circuits. These\ncould be related to early nociception, attentional orienting, noci-\nfensive responses, or other processes; whatever the case, they are\nmore strongly related to stimulus intensity than to pain report.\n\nConversely, several regions were related to pain but showed no\nrelationship with stimulus intensity. These regions may support\nthe cognitive and affective processes that contribute to pain evalu-\nation, such as magnitude estimation, conceptual representation,\nand fluctuations in arousal and attention. The medial and lateral\nOFC have been associated with expected value and outcome expec-\ntancy [45,68]. The DLPFC is broadly associated with decision mak-\ning and executive function [54,55], and the right DMPFC has been\nassociated with prospection and mental simulation [1,3]. These\nsystems may be responsible when contextual factors influence\npain without affecting nociception (ie, as a function of decision-\nmaking processes).\n\nPrevious studies isolated brain regions whose activation during\nrating predicts variation in pain [9,44]. An extension of the present\nwork might use mediation to separate regions whose activation\nduring the report period is related to heat, and those whose pain-\nrelated responses are related to endogenous variations in report-\ning-related activity alone. These would be informative probes of\nactivity related to decision-making biases or memory-related pro-\ncesses. Our study was not designed to address reporting-period\nactivity, as motor-related processes would correlate with heat-\nrelated processes due to the consistent mapping of increased pain\nto rightward movement on our scale.\n\nThe pattern of temperature-related versus pain-related regions\nprovides new evidence on the question of whether these processes\nare encoded in different circuits. One pioneering fMRI study\nassociated thermosensation with dpIns and pain perception with\naINS [29]. We also found that contralateral dpIns showed linear\nincreases with temperature but did not predict pain; however,\nthe picture is likely to be more complex, as other portions of dpINS\n\n\n\nL.Y. Atlas et al. / PAIN\n\ufffd\n\n155 (2014) 1632\u20131648 1647\npredicted pain but did not respond to temperature, replicating\nrecent results [9], and anterior portions of aINS/operculum tracked\ntemperature without predicting pain. In addition, our data\nappeared to show posterior\u2013anterior gradients in the insula and\ndACC from pain report to stimulus encoding. Previous studies have\nfound similar gradients in the parietal cortex [6]. These should be\nreplicated and explicitly tested with spatial statistics in future\nstudies.\n\n4.4. Future directions\n\nThere are several important outstanding questions, including\nthe need for more information on (1) the specificity of brain\nresponses to pain, (2) connections between experimental thermal\npain and other types of pain (eg, inflammatory and neuropathic\npain), (3) further characterization of complex responses to stimu-\nlus intensity and pain (eg, nonlinearities and temporal dissocia-\ntions [6,15,63], and (4) sources of individuals\u2019 variability in path\neffects (ie, understanding effects on mediators driven by covari-\nance), such as gender differences and relationship to psychological\nvariables (eg, fear of pain, anxiety).\n\nAlthough assessment of these questions is beyond the scope of\nthe current study, the specificity issue deserves discussion.\nWe observed heterogeneity in PPBN responses, suggesting that\nthis network contains both thermosensory regions and regions\ninvolved in both thermosensation and magnitude estimation.\nHowever, we examined only one modality in this study, and cannot\ndetermine whether stimulus intensity effects and relationships\nwith subjective reports would be similar in other modalities, or\nwhether the relationships that we observed are unique to nocicep-\ntion and pain. AIns and dACC are activated by a range of tasks\n[9,31,85]. One view is that aIns mediates general interoception\n[27,28], and dACC and aIns integrate salient external stimuli of\nall types with internal states [23]. A similar argument has been\nmade for somatosensory regions [58]. Another view is that these\nregions contain many types of neurons that encode diverse, but\nspecific, processes, including nociception and pain, and indeed,\nresponses within these regions predict pain across individuals with\nhigh accuracy [78]. Future research should use mediation to link\nstimulus intensity with perception across domains and to deter-\nmine the specificity of pathways identified here.\n\n4.5. Conclusion\n\nPain is generated by a combination of independent networks.\nSome are involved in nociception and pain in a classic sense: They\nshow graded responses to noxious input, and responses predict the\nmagnitude of pain. Others show decreases with temperature that\npredict pain increases and may be related to mental processes that\nantagonize (or sometimes promote) pain. Finally, some regions\npredict pain without responding to noxious input per se, and\nmay encode decision-making processes that shape pain evaluation.\nThe networks identified here provide a rich neurophysiological\nbasis for understanding diverse pain-generation processes, and this\napproach can be extended to stimulus effects on conscious percep-\ntion in other domains.\nConflict of interest statement\n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors acknowledge Katherine Dahl and Natalie Johnston\nfor assistance with data collection.

correlates of either noxious stimulusintensity or reported pain. Although useful, analyzing brain relationships with stimulus intensity andbehavior separately does not address how sensation and pain are linked in the central nervous system.In this study, we used multi-level mediation analysis to identify brain mediators of pain\u2014regions inwhich trial-by-trial responses to heat explained variability in the relationship between noxious stimulusintensity (across 4 levels) and pain. This approach has the potential to identify multiple circuits withcomplementary roles in pain genesis. Brain mediators of noxious heat effects on pain included targetsof ascending nociceptive pathways (anterior cingulate, insula, SII, and medial thalamus) and also prefron-tal and subcortical regions not associated with nociceptive pathways per se. Cluster analysis revealed thatmediators were grouped into several distinct functional networks, including the following: somatosen-sory, paralimbic, and striatal-cerebellar networks that increased with stimulus intensity; and 2 networksco-localized with \u2018\u2018default mode\u2019\u2019 regions in which stimulus intensity-related decreases mediatedincreased pain. We also identi\ufb01ed \u2018\u2018thermosensory\u2019\u2019 regions that responded to increasing noxious heatbut did not predict pain reports. Finally, several regions did not respond to noxious input, but theiractivity predicted pain; these included ventromedial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,cerebellar regions, and supplementary motor cortices. These regions likely underlie both nociceptiveand non-nociceptive processes that contribute to pain, such as attention and decision-making processes.Overall, these results elucidate how multiple distinct brain systems jointly contribute to the centralgeneration of pain.\ufffd 2014 International Association for the Study of Pain.
